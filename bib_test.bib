	abstract = {This paper aimed to develop a mechanistic model for wall heat flux partitioning based on bubble dynamics in horizontal subcooled flow boiling. The model was established from two dimensions of space and time. In the space dimension, the heating surface was divided into three regions based on the motion characteristics of bubbles, including bubble nucleation region, bubble sliding region, and non-boiling region. In the time dimension, the heat transfer mechanism on the heating surface of the bubble nucleation region and bubble sliding region could be divided into evaporation, condensation, and transient heat transfer. An evaporation model for subcooled boiling was developed based on condensation at the top of the bubble. A transient quench heat transfer model for subcooled flow boiling was modified. The heat flux of each region was obtained by the sum of the time-averaged heat fluxes of these heat transfer mechanisms during a bubble periodic time. The total wall heat flux was obtained by the sum of the area weights of the heat fluxes in these three regions. The new wall heat flux partitioning model and the {RPI} model were used to predict the experimental values at a variety of flow conditions. The results showed that the new model could well predict the experimental values and the deviation between the predicted heat flux and the experimental results was within 25\%. The study also found that it was necessary to consider the condensation at the top of the bubble and the heat transfer mechanism caused by bubble sliding.},

	abstract = {We report on a series of fully resolved simulations of the flow around a rigid sphere translating steadily near a wall, either in a fluid at rest or in the presence of a uniform shear. Nonrotating and freely rotating spheres subject to a torque-free condition are both considered to evaluate the importance of spin-induced effects. The separation distance between the sphere and wall is varied from values at which the wall influence is weak down to gaps of half the sphere radius. The Reynolds number based on the sphere diameter and relative velocity with respect to the ambient fluid spans the range 0.1–250, and the relative shear rate defined as the ratio of the shear-induced velocity variation across the sphere to the relative velocity is varied from −0.5 to +0.5, so that the sphere either leads the fluid or lags behind it. The wall-induced interaction mechanisms at play in the various flow regimes are analyzed qualitatively by examining the flow structure, especially the spanwise and streamwise vorticity distributions. Variations of the drag and lift forces at low-but-finite and moderate Reynolds number are compared with available analytical and semiempirical expressions, respectively. In more inertial regimes, empirical expressions for the two force components are derived based on the numerical data, yielding accurate fits valid over a wide range of Reynolds number and wall-sphere separations for both nonrotating and torque-free spheres.},

	abstract = {Computational Fluid Dynamics ({CFD}) offers the opportunity to investigate physically and geometrically complex systems with high fidelity. Its applicability to multiphase flow, and particularly boiling heat transfer, is currently limited by the lack of appropriate closure models to describe all relevant phenomena. In this paper, we present an original subcooled flow boiling modeling framework for {CFD}, which aims at consistently and accurately characterizing the key physics that affect heat transfer at the boiling surface. The new framework introduces a fully mechanistic representation of heterogeneous boiling that improves numerical robustness and reduces sensitivity to closure coefficients. The proposed formulation is inspired by new experimental insight, and significantly extends the existing boiling models by capturing the effects of (i) the microlayer on surface evaporation, (ii) the boiling surface, and (iii) bubbles sliding along the boiling surface. A new statistical treatment of the location and mutual interactions of bubbles on the surface allows for mechanistic prediction of the dry surface area, an important quantity that affects the boiling heat transfer coefficient. This approach lends itself naturally to extension to very high heat fluxes, potentially up to the critical heat flux. An assessment and sensitivity study of the model is presented for a range of mass fluxes (500–1250kg/m2/s), heat fluxes (100–1600kW/m2), inlet subcoolings (5, 10, 15K), and pressures (1, 1.5, 2 bars), demonstrating improved robustness and predictive accuracy at all tested conditions in comparison to traditional heat partitioning approaches, including high heat fluxes, where classic models often fail to converge. Lastly, the framework proposed here should not be viewed as another heat partitioning model, but rather as a general platform that allows incorporation of advanced models for each physical phenomenon considered, leveraging the growing insight generated by modern experimental diagnostics for boiling heat transfer.},

	abstract = {In this work a mechanistic model has been developed for the wall heat flux partitioning during subcooled flow boiling. The premise of the proposed model is that the entire energy from the wall is first transferred to the superheated liquid layer adjacent to the wall. A fraction of this energy is then utilized for vapor generation, while the rest of the energy is utilized for sensible heating of the bulk liquid. The contribution of each of the mechanisms for transfer of heat to the liquid—forced convection and transient conduction, as well as the energy transport associated with vapor generation has been quantified in terms of nucleation site densities, bubble departure and lift-off diameters, bubble release frequency, flow parameters like velocity, inlet subcooling, wall superheat, and fluid and surface properties including system pressure. To support the model development, subcooled flow boiling experiments were conducted at pressures of 1.03–3.2 bar for a wide range of mass fluxes 124-926kg/m2 s, heat fluxes 2.5-90W/cm2 and for contact angles varying from 30° to 90°. The model developed shows that the transient conduction component can become the dominant mode of heat transfer at very high superheats and, hence, velocity does not have much effect at high superheats. This is particularly true when boiling approaches fully developed nucleate boiling. Also, the model developed allows prediction of the wall superheat as a function of the applied heat flux or axial distance along the flow direction.},

This indicates that the proposed model can be extended to other flow conditions provided the submodels cover the conditions of the experiments. Future work should be directed towards improvement of the various submodels involved to extend their range of applicability, especially the ones related to bubble dynamics.

	abstract = {A forced convection boiling facility has been fabricated in which vapor bubble departure can be investigated. It has been observed that once a vapor bubble departs from its nucleation site, it typically slides along the heating surface and lifts off at some finite distance downstream. The probability density functions (pdfs) for bubble departure diameter, d, have been obtained for mass flux, C, ranging from 112 to 287 kg m−2 s−1 and heat flux, qw, ranging from 11.0 to 26.0 {kW} m−2. The data indicate a systematic dependence of d on G and qw. A detailed analysis of various forces acting on the bubble is presented and is used to predict the mean departure diameter. The onset of imbalance between the quasi-steady drag, the unsteady component of the drag due to asymmetrical bubble growth, and the surface tension force in the flow direction is used as a criterion for departure and yields satisfactory agreement between the measured and predicted values of the mean departure diameter. The analytical prediction shows a strong influence of mean liquid velocity and wall superheat on the bubble departure diameter. At the point of departure the surface tension force in the flow direction is generally small.},

Since the cube of the bubble departure diameter is used in subcooled flow boiling heat transfer models, such errors are unacceptable, and underscore the need for greater accuracy in predictions. Therefore, the databases were used to (i) identify the dominant forces determining bubble departure at various operating conditions, and (ii) optimize the empirical coefficients describing those forces in Klausner’s model. The modified model considerably lowers prediction error to 22.4\% (σ=19.9\%) for all data considered. Application of the modified model is demonstrated for the subcooled flow boiling conditions present in the hot channel of a typical Pressurized Water Reactor ({PWR}).},

	abstract = {In flow boiling systems, bubbles tend to slide along the wall as they depart from nucleation sites where they originate. This behavior has a profound impact on the wall heat transfer as evidenced in previous experiments. As a result, the heat transfer modeling associated with sliding bubbles has gained great attention within the {CFD} boiling heat transfer community. The modeling efforts are primarily aimed at improving the Heat Flux Partitioning ({HFP}) model by accounting for the heat transfer mechanisms introduced by sliding bubbles. The performance of the {HFP} model depends inherently on the accuracy of sub-models to predict the fundamental bubble parameters, such as bubble departure and lift-off diameters. Similarly, the accurate prediction of sliding bubble parameters, such as sliding bubble growth and sliding bubble velocity, is critical to improving the {HFP} model when taking into account the effect of sliding bubbles. Of the many sliding bubble parameters, this paper deals with the sliding bubble velocity. Specifically, a force balance model is presented and assessed in view of the sliding bubble velocity prediction. The experimental results from Maity (2000)[1] and Yoo et al. (2016)[2] are used to demonstrate the force balance model accuracy under various subcooled boiling conditions of both, water and refrigerant ({NOVEC}-7000) flowing upward in vertical channels. We performed a parametric study of the key sub-models (e.g., drag force, bubble growth) used in the force balance equation, together with a direct comparison with proposed models from other researchers. Then, a new force balance model is proposed which outperforms previous models and consistently well-predicts both sliding bubble velocity and growth.},

The combination of the test section design, high-speed video camera and {LED} lighting results in high accuracy (order of 20μm) in the determination of the bubble departure diameter. The data indicate that the bubble departure diameter increases with increasing heat flux, decreasing mass flux, decreasing subcooling, and decreasing pressure. Also, the bubble departure diameter increases with decreasing orientation angle, i.e. the largest bubbles are found to detach from a downward-facing horizontal surface. The mechanistic bubble departure diameter model of Klausner et al. and its recent modification by Yun et al. were found to correctly predict all the observed parametric trends, but with large average errors and standard deviation: 65.5±75.8\% for Klausner's and 37.9±51.2\% for Yun's.

	abstract = {The behavior of bubble coalescence in subcooled boiling has a significant influence on the void fraction and heat transfer capacity. In this paper, a visual flow boiling experiment is carried out to investigate the phenomenon of bubble coalescence and the effect of sliding bubbles on coalescence. The phenomenon of bubble coalescence, the velocity of bubble and interface evolution characteristics after coalescence are analyzed in detail. The annular waves caused by the rupture of the thick liquid film and the severe deformation caused by bubble coalescence are observed during the experiment. The propagation of annular waves on bubble surfaces makes bubbles unstable and then easily breaks down to produce secondary bubbles. Unlike the secondary bubbles produced by air bubble coalescence, the critical diameter of initial average bubbles that produce secondary bubbles after bubble coalescence is about 0.87 mm. This difference is because the viscosity of the fluid at high temperature in boiling two-phase flow is different from that in adiabatic water-air two-phase flow. Besides, it is found that there is an oscillation adjustment zone after bubble coalescence. This stage is divided into the violent oscillation region and moderation region, and their duration is basically the same. The relative velocity of sliding bubbles during collision is obtained according to the velocity difference between bubbles and the growth rate of the sliding bubble. Also, the effect of sliding bubbles on bubble coalescence is analyzed in this paper.},

	abstract = {An experiment is carried out using a high-speed camera to closely observe the bubble behaviors on a horizontal aluminum heating surface under high mass flux. Subcooled flow boiling experiments are conducted at Reynolds numbers of 61,850–124,041 for a range of density ratios (0.000647-0.001153), Jacob numbers corresponding to wall superheat (0.012201-0.025096) and for Jacob numbers corresponding to subcooling varying from 0.009549 to 0.02856. The experimental results indicate that both bubble departure diameter ({BDD}) and bubble contact diameter ({BCD}) reduce with increasing system pressure, increasing flow velocity, increasing subcooling, and decreasing wall superheat. The experiment confirms that the linear relationship between {BCD} and {BDD} is still valid under high mass flux. The {BCD} is 0.4027 times of the {BDD}. A force balance model based on the newly modified model of bubble growth rate is used to calculate {BDD} and its predicted values are in good agreement with the present measured values. The force balance model can be expressed by a series of dimensionless parameters: density ratio, Jacob number corresponding to wall superheat, Jacob number corresponding to subcooling, Prandtl number, Reynolds number, and contact angle. A new empirical formula of {BDD} in a horizontal channel is developed based on the dimensionless parameters using the Buckingham theorem. The empirical formula considers more comprehensive factors and predicts the {BDD} obtained in a horizontal channel with an average relative error of 12.08\%.},

The model utilizes a force balance similar to that proposed by Klausner et al. (Int. J. Heat Mass Transfer 36, 651–662 (1993)). One significant improvement is that the inclination angle is determined on a dynamic basis and is not required as an input. Furthermore, it is hypothesized that the surface tension force is small compared to other forces acting on a vapor bubble at the points of departure and lift-off, and thus information on the bubble contact diameter and contact angles is not required. A new data set on mean vapor bubble lift-off diameters and probability density functions (pdf's) for flow boiling of refrigerant R113 on a nichrome heating strip has been obtained using the experimental facility described by Klausner et al.

In this paper, the effects of these forces can be concluded by a series of dimensionless parameters including density ratio of vapor and liquid, Prandtl number, Jacob number and bubble Reynolds number. Based on the different forces, two different characteristic lengths are adopted to non-dimensionlize bubble departure diameters in horizontal flow boiling and vertical flow boiling, respectively. Finally, the semi-empirical correlations for bubble departure diameters in both horizontal and vertical subcooled flow boiling are proposed in this paper based on the force balance analysis and available experimental data from literature. The predicted results using the present correlations agree fairly well with the experimentally measured values with a mean relative error of 19.72\%.},

	abstract = {In the context of computational fluid dynamic simulations of boiling flows using time-averaged Eulerian multi-phase approaches, the many sub-models required to describe such a complex phenomena are of particular importance. Of interest here, wall boiling requires calculation of the contribution of evaporation to global heat transfer, which in turn relies on determination of the active nucleation site density, bubble departure diameter and frequency of bubble departure. In this paper, an improved mechanistic model for the bubble departure diameter during flow boiling is developed. The model is based on the balance of forces acting on a bubble at a single nucleation site, with a new equation governing bubble growth proposed. The formulation accounts for evaporation of the micro-layer under the bubble, heat transfer from superheated liquid around the bubble surface, and condensation on the bubble cap due to the presence of sub-cooled liquid. Validation of the growth equation is provided through comparison against experiments in both pool boiling and flow boiling conditions. Introduction of condensation on the bubble cap allows reproduction of the growth of the bubble for different sub-cooling temperatures of the surrounding liquid. In addition, a sensitivity study guarantees dependency of the bubble departure diameter on relevant physical quantities such as mass flow rate, heat flux, liquid sub-cooling and pressure, with any inclination of the channel walls correctly accounted for. Predictions of bubble departure diameter and bubble lift-off are validated against three different databases on sub-cooled flow boiling with water and an additional database on saturated boiling with refrigerant R113. The whole data set guarantees validation is performed over a range of parameters and operating conditions as broad as possible. Satisfactory predictive accuracy is obtained in all conditions. The present formulation provides an appropriate starting point for prediction of the behaviour of vapour bubbles under more general conditions which include lift-off after sliding, the frequency of bubble departure, bubble merging and bubble shrinking and collapse due to condensation.},

The physical assumptions of the existing bubble growth models were modified to reflect the intrinsic physics associated with the sliding bubble growth. The heat transfer mechanisms considered are microlayer evaporation, evaporation of superheated liquid, and condensation. The present model has been successfully validated against a broad set of subcooled flow boiling data, generated by three separate research groups using different working fluids and different heater surfaces. The model successfully reproduced the sliding bubble growth dependencies on mass flux, wall superheat, and liquid subcooling level as observed in the experiments. On the other hand, in a few cases where the bubble growth inertia was substantially involved in the sliding bubble growth, the predictive ability was limited.},

Experiments with a refrigerant {HFE}7000 were performed in the range of Reynolds numbers from 13 000 to 40 500, subcoolings close to 15 ∘C, for constant heating power, constant wall temperature and constant heating rates (linear increase of the wall temperature). With constant heating power, the wall heat flux is well predicted by a Chen-type correlation based on a contribution due to the forced convection and a contribution due to nucleate boiling, including the effect of the liquid subcooling. A thin layer of bubbles sliding along the wall is observed. The characteristic diameter of the bubbles increases with the heat flux and decreases with the liquid velocity and its subcooling. The bubble diameters can be well predicted versus 3 dimensionless numbers: the Reynolds number of the flow, the Jakob number based on the liquid subcooling and the Boiling number. A drag coefficient of the bubbles sliding on the wall is estimated from the measurements of the bubble relative velocities and is in good agreement with the recent numerical simulation of Shi et al. [1] for a spherical bubble moving close to a wall in a shear flow. In the experiments with a constant set temperature, a non-homogeneity of the surface temperatures is observed as well as high fluctuations of temperatures and heat fluxes. The heat transfer is strongly degraded ( ≃ 60\%) by comparison with heating with a set power. Finally a transient nucleate boiling regime with a constant temperature increase {dT}/dt is investigated. For {dT}/dt {\textless} 50 ∘C.s−1, the results are similar to those of Auracher and Marquardt and a correlation for the prediction of the wall heat flux versus the wall temperature in the transient nucleate boiling regime is provided.},

	abstract = {The {NEPTUNE} project constitutes the thermal-hydraulic part of the long-term Electricité de France and Commissariat à l’Energie Atomique joint research and development program for the next generation of nuclear reactor simulation tools. This program is also financially supported by the Institut de Radioprotection et Sûreté Nucléaire and {AREVA} {NP}. The project aims at developing a new software platform for advanced two-phase flow thermal hydraulics covering the whole range of modeling scales and allowing easy multiscale and multidisciplinary calculations. {NEPTUNE} is a fully integrated project that covers the following fields: software development, research in physical modeling and numerical methods, development of advanced instrumentation techniques, and performance of new experimental programs.The analysis of the industrial needs points out that three main simulation scales are involved. The system scale is dedicated to the overall description of the reactor. The component or subchannel scale allows three-dimensional computations of the main components of the reactors: cores, steam generators, condensers, and heat exchangers. The current generation of system and component codes has reached a very high level of maturity for industrial applications. The third scale, computational fluid dynamics ({CFD}) in open medium, allows one to go beyond the limits of the component scale for a finer description of the flows. This scale opens promising perspectives for industrial simulations, and the development and validation of the {NEPTUNE} {CFD} module have been a priority since the beginning of the project. It is based on advanced physical models (two-fluid or multifield model combined with interfacial area transport and two-phase turbulence) and modern numerical methods (fully unstructured finite volume solvers). For the system and component scales, prototype developments have also started, including new physical models and numerical methods.In addition to scale-specific developments, the generalized use of multiscale calculations is also expected to be a major means to meet the industrial needs. The coexistence of different simulation scales together with the fast growth of computing power multiplies the computation possibilities. In particular, thanks to the recent progress of {CFD} tools, one can imagine local zooms in some critical parts of the reactor components. The {NEPTUNE} multiscale platform will offer advanced coupling functionalities based on state-of-the-art software architecture and new numerical coupling techniques.Finally, despite the existence of a huge worldwide database of two-phase flow experiments, the validation of new physical models (more local, more complex) requires new experimental data. That is the reason why for several years we have been developing new instrumentation techniques such as four-sensor optical probes, X-ray tomography, and hot-wire anemometry. These techniques will be used for new experimental programs (currently being launched) that have been defined in connection with the high-priority industrial applications (departure from nucleate boiling, pressurized thermal shock, loss-of-coolant accident, etc.).},

These measurements were complemented with two high-speed cameras to capture the corresponding bubbles’ dynamics. The liquid–vapor interactions were captured in detail over the full life-cycle of sliding bubbles. Four distinctive phases for the bubble life-cycle were identified: A) Spherical bubble growth with strong attachment, B) Deformed bubble growth with weak attachment, C) Detachment with hot liquid quenching, and D) Cold liquid quenching. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, it is the first time that the “detachment with hot liquid quenching phase has been observed. This phase is characterized by a “hot” thermal footprint during the bubble detachment process. It is believed that this footprint is constituted partially from hot liquid released during the condensation of the recently detached bubble, and from released hot fluid previously collected by the bubble during sliding. In addition, this work reveals that using traditional high-speed visualization techniques (side-view camera only) can lead to an underestimation of approximately 40\% of the actual bubble–wall contact diameter (dc) which was inferred from the infrared camera measurements.},

The methodology is based on high-speed video and high-speed {InfraRed} ({IR}) diagnostics, combined with advanced post-processing techniques developed in-house. It also provides hitherto unavailable direct estimates of the individual terms of wall heat flux partitioning in subcooled flow boiling; such information is crucially relevant to the validation of the latest mechanistic flow boiling heat transfer and {CHF} models. Experiments were performed using deionized ({DI}) water, on a rectangular cross-section channel (3 × 1 cm2), at atmospheric pressure and 10 °C of subcooling, for three mass fluxes (500 kg/m2/s, 750 kg/m2/s, and 1000 kg/m2/s). For each set of operating conditions, the average heat flux was escalated from single-phase forced convection up to the occurrence of {CHF}, and all boiling parameters were recorded at each heat flux. The trends of measured wait time, growth time and bubble departure diameter were successfully captured by mechanistic models developed or co-developed by the authors. Measurements of the wall heat flux partitioning have revealed that the contribution of microlayer evaporation increases monotonically with the increase of the average heat flux, due to the increase of nucleation site density and bubble departure frequency. However, for our specific heater and operating conditions, the contribution of the microlayer evaporation barely exceeds 50\% of the total heat flux, right before {CHF}.},

Résumé
Un modèle mathématique d'une bulle contrôlé par le transport de chaleur a produit trois corrélations semi-empiriques pour la prévision de la vitesse de croissance d'une bulle, du diamètre maximal d'une bulle et de la durée maximale de croissance d'une bulle pour l'ébullition en écoulement nuclée sousrefroidie de l'eau. Nos résultats pour le diamètre maximal d'une bulle pour 13,9, 15,8 et 17,7 {MN}/m2, obtenus au moyen de photographie ultra-rapide et les données qui existent dans la littérature ont été trouvés de convenir aux corrélations. La région de données corrélées est la suivante: pression: 0,1–17,7 {MN}/m2; flux de chaleur 0,47–10,64 {MW}/m2; vitesse: 0,08–9,15 m/s; sous-refroidissement: 3–86K; diamètre maximal d'une bulle: 0,08–1,24 mm; durée maximale de croissance d'une bulle: 0,175–5 ms.

	abstract = {The bubble departure characteristics are studied in flow boiling considering the available experimental data in the literature. The current bubble departure diameter and departure frequency models are reviewed and compared with the collected database, revealing the current modeling shortcomings in forced convective flows. Based on an energy balance approach at the heated surface, the important dimensionless groups are identified and correlated for the bubble departure diameter and departure frequency. These dimensionless groups are the Jakob number, Boiling number, density ratio, and Prandtl number. The bubble departure diameter data also suggests some effect of the flow geometry in mini-channels. The newly proposed semi-empirical models for the bubble departure diameter and departure frequency are shown based on the available database to be accurate to within ±22\% and ±35\% respectively. This work also identifies important future experimental considerations for the bubble departure characteristics including data at elevated pressures, larger Prandtl numbers, and around the boundary between mini and conventional channels.},

Capturing the transition between these two regimes has been possible for the first time using very refined grids and parallel computations. Indeed, grids with a cell size under 1 μm must be used in order to capture thermal and dynamical effects in the micro-layer. Such multiscale computations require advanced code capabilities. The present simulations are used to analyse the physical processes involved in the formation and depletion of a micro-layer. A parametric study is carried out to investigate the impact of the main parameters affecting the presence of the micro-layer. From these results, the limit conditions between nucleate boiling in micro-layer and contact line regimes are deduced. Neglecting the micro-layer would lead to erroneous results because it has a strong influence on the overall bubble growth. Therefore the present results could be of major interest for designing models of nucleate pool boiling in larger scales computations, when the micro-layer cannot be resolved.},

We derive a specific criterion for modelling the transition based on a synthesis of existing theoretical, experimental and numerical data. As a result, a new formulation of the transition criterion is developed, and applied to (i) reference data from a dewetting experiment of a volatile liquid, and (ii) results derived from a high-resolution direct numerical simulation of nucleate boiling.

	abstract = {The growth of a vapor bubble in a superheated liquid is controlled by three factors: the inertia of the liquid, the surface tension, and the vapor pressure. As the bubble grows, evaporation takes place at the bubble boundary, and the temperature and vapor pressure in the bubble are thereby decreased. The heat inflow requirement of evaporation, however, depends on the rate of bubble growth, so that the dynamic problem is linked with a heat diffusion problem. Since the heat diffusion problem has been solved, a quantitative formulation of the dynamic problem can be given. A solution for the radius of the vapor bubble as a function of time is obtained which is valid for sufficiently large radius. This asymptotic solution covers the range of physical interest since the radius at which it becomes valid is near the lower limit of experimental observation. It shows the strong effect of heat diffusion on the rate of bubble growth. Comparison of the predicted radius-time behavior is made with experimental observations in superheated water, and very good agreement is found.},

These behaviors are less marked for motion on a 100-μm line surface, or on lines oriented parallel to the slope direction. Smaller droplets slide down with greater displacement in the line direction on 500-μm line patterning when the lines were rotated at 13° in-plane for the slope direction. This sliding behavior depended on the droplet size and rotation angle, and is accountable by the balance between gravitational and retentive forces.},

A significant part of the paper is devoted to a discussion of drag, added-mass force, and shear-induced lift experienced by spheroidal bubbles moving in inertially dominated, time-dependent, rotational, nonuniform flows. The important influence of surfactants and shape distortion on bubble motion in a quiescent liquid is highlighted.

	shorttitle = {Temperature dependence of the contact angle of water},
	abstract = {Contact angle, a quantitative measure of macroscopic surface wettability, plays an important role in understanding liquid-vapor heterogeneous phase change phenomena, e.g., boiling heat transfer. The contact angles of water at elevated temperatures are of particular interest for understanding of wettability-regulated boiling heat transfer in steam-based power generation. From a more theoretical perspective, the temperature dependence of contact angle of water is also essential to estimation of several key surface thermodynamic properties, such as the solid surface tension, the surface entropy, and the heats of immersion and adsorption. Here, a comprehensive review of historical efforts in measuring the contact angles of water over a wide temperature range on a variety of solids, not limited to metallic surfaces, is presented. As suggested by the literature data, the temperature dependence of contact angle of water may be classified into three regimes: (a) low temperatures below the saturation point (i.e., 100 °C at atmospheric pressure), (b) medium temperatures up to {\textasciitilde}170 °C, and (c) high temperatures up to 300 °C at pressurized conditions. A slightly-decreasing or nearly-invariant trend of the contact angles of water on both non-metallic and metallic surfaces was reported for the low-temperature regime. In contrast, a steeper linear decline in water contact angle was demonstrated at temperatures above 100 °C. The few experimental data available on several metallic surfaces showed that the contact angle of water either again becomes nearly temperature-independent or further decreases with temperature above 210 °C. A theoretical understanding of the temperature dependence is given based on surface thermodynamic analysis, although the exact molecular mechanisms underlying these experimental observations remain unclear. Consequently, the theoretical model for predicting the variation of the contact angle of water with temperature is not well-developed. As the critical point of water (374 °C and 22.1 {MPa}) is approached, the surface tension, and hence the contact angle, should become vanishingly small. However, this theoretical expectation has not yet been verified due to the lack of experimental data at such high temperatures/pressures. Finally, future research directions are identified, including a systematic exploration of the contact angle at near-critical temperatures, the effects of surface oxidation, corrosion, and deposition on contact angle during operation of boilers and reactors, and the particular effect of irradiation on contact angle in nuclear reactor applications.},

A vertical flow boiling facility was constructed with a transparent, electrically-heated test section in which the ebullition process could be observed. High-speed digital images of flow boiling phenomena were obtained, which were used to measure bubble growth, departure diameters, and lift-off diameters. Experiments were conducted for flow of {FC}-87 over a commercially-finished nichrome heating surface, with mass flux ranging from 190 to 666 kg m−2 s−1 and heat flux ranging from 1.3 to 14.6 {kW}{\textbackslash}m2. The flow was slightly subcooled (ΔTsub = 1.0–5.0°C), and boiling occurred at isolated nucleation sites. A major conclusion of this work is that the observed vapor bubble dynamics between upflow and downflow are significantly different. In the upflow configuration, bubbles departing the nucleation site slide along the heater wall, and typically do not lift off. In the downflow configuration, bubbles either lift off directly from the nucleation site or slide and then lift off, depending on flow and thermal conditions. The process of vapor bubble sliding appears to be responsible for enhanced energy transfer from the heating surface, as evidenced by larger heat transfer coefficients for upflow than for downflow under otherwise identical operating conditions.},

	abstract = {The three-dimensional flow around a spherical bubble moving steadily
 in a viscous 
linear shear flow is studied numerically by solving the full Navier–Stokes
 equations. 
The bubble surface is assumed to be clean so that the outer flow obeys
 a zero-shear-stress 
condition and does not induce any rotation of the bubble. The main goal
 of the 
present study is to provide a complete description of the lift force experienced
 by the 
bubble and of the mechanisms responsible for this force over a wide range
 of Reynolds 
number (0.1[les     ]Re[les     ]500, Re being based on 
the bubble diameter) and shear rate (0[les     ]Sr[les     ]1, Sr
 
being the ratio between the velocity difference across the bubble and the
 
relative velocity). For that purpose the structure of the flow field, the
 influence of the 
Reynolds number on the streamwise vorticity field and the distribution
 of the 
tangential velocities at the surface of the bubble are first studied in
 detail. It is shown 
that the latter distribution which plays a central role in the production
 of the lift force 
is dramatically dependent on viscous effects. The numerical results concerning
 the lift 
coefficient reveal very different behaviours at low and high Reynolds numbers.
 These 
two asymptotic regimes shed light on the respective roles played by the
 vorticity 
produced at the bubble surface and by that contained in the undisturbed
 flow. At low 
Reynolds number it is found that the lift coefficient depends strongly
 on both the 
Reynolds number and the shear rate. In contrast, for moderate to high Reynolds
 
numbers these dependences are found to be very weak. The numerical values
 obtained 
for the lift coefficient agree very well with available asymptotic results
 in the low- and 
high-Reynolds-number limits. The range of validity of these asymptotic
 solutions is 
specified by varying the characteristic parameters of the problem and examining
 the 
corresponding evolution of the lift coefficient. The numerical results
 are also used for 
obtaining empirical correlations useful for practical calculations at finite
 Reynolds 
number. The transient behaviour of the lift force is then examined. It
 is found that, 
starting from the undisturbed flow, the value of the lift force at short
 time differs from 
its steady value, even when the Reynolds number is high, because the vorticity
 field 
needs a finite time to reach its steady distribution. This finding is confirmed
 by an 
analytical derivation of the initial value of the lift coefficient in an
 inviscid shear flow. 
Finally, a specific investigation of the evolution of the lift and drag
 coefficients with the 
shear rate at high Reynolds number is carried out. It is found that when
 the shear rate 
becomes large, i.e. Sr=O(1), a small but 
consistent decrease of the lift coefficient 
occurs while a very significant increase of the drag coefficient, essentially
 produced by 
the modifications of the pressure distribution, is observed. Some of the
 foregoing 
results are used to show that the well-known equality between the added
 mass 
coefficient and the lift coefficient holds only in the limit of weak shears
 and nearly 
steady flows.},

	abstract = {The physical principles governing bubble growth in a superheated liquid were originally formulated by Bosnjakovic and Jakob. Using these principles, Fritz and Ende derived an approximate formula for the growth of a bubble in a uniformly superheated liquid. It is shown below that the energy considerations in the Bosnjakovic-Jakob analysis enable one to calculate also the approximate rate of growth of a bubble on a heated surface in a liquid at saturation. One need only take into account the heat flux from the heated surface to the liquid. One can improve the agreement with experimental data by making corrections which have already been applied by other authors to bubbles in a uniformly superheated liquid. Experimental data for bubbles growing and collapsing in subcooled boiling can be approximated similarly by considering the growth and collapse process separately. The growth rate is given by the extended Bosnjakovic-Jakob analysis described above. As shown by Bankoff and Mikesell, the collapse rate can be predicted by the solution of Rayleigh's equation for an isothermal process. The growth and collapse process can be combined by matching them at the maximum bubble radius, thus giving a complete picture of the life history of bubbles formed in subcooled boiling.
Résumé
Les principes physiques qui régissent le développement d'une bulle dans un liquide surchauffé ont été formulés, à l'origine par Bosnjakovic et Jakob. En utilisant ces principes, Fritz et Ende ont déduit une formule approchée pour le grossissement d'une bulle dans un liquide uniformément surchauffé. Il est montré ci-dessous que les considérations énergétiques de l'analyse de Bosnjakovic-Jakob permettent également de calculer la vitesse approchée de grossissement d'une bulle à la surface chauffée d'un liquide saturé. Il suffit de tenir compte du flux de chaleur de la surface chauffée vers le liquide. On peut améliorer l'accord avec les données expérimentales en faisant les corrections déjà appliquées par les autres auteurs aux bulles dans un liquide uniformément surchauffé. Les données expérimentales pour des bulles grossissant et éclatant au cours d'une ebullition à basse température sont susceptibles d'une similitude approximative si l'on considère séparément les processus du grossissement et de l'éclatement. La vitesse de grossissement est donnée par l'extension de l'étude de Bosnjakovic-Jakob décrite ci-dessus. Comme l'ont montre Bankoff et Mikesell, la vitesse d'éclatement peut être prévue par la solution de l'équation de Rayleigh pour un processus isotherme. Grossissement et éclatement peuvent être combinés pour le rayon de bulle maximum, donnant ainsi une vue complète de l'histoire de la vie des bulles qui se forment dans l'ébullition à basse température.
Zusammenfassung
Die physikalischen Prinzipien des Blasenwachstums in überhitzter Flüssigkeit sind ursprünglich von Bosnjakovic und Jakob formuliert worden. Fritz und Ende leiteten unter Benutzung dieser Prinzipien eine Näherungsgleichung für das Blasenwachstum in gleichförmig überhitzter Flüssigkeit ab. Es wird weiter unten gezeigt, dass man mit Hilfe der Energiebetrachtungen von Bosnjakovic und Jakob auch das Blasenwachstum an einer Heizfläche in gesättigter Flüssigkeit näherungsweise berechnen kann, wenn man den Wärmestrom von der Heizfläche zur Flüssigkeit in Betracht zieht. Beim Vergleich mit Versuchsergebnissen sind Korrekturen erforderlich, wie sie auch von anderen Autoren auf Blasen in gleichförmig überhitzter Flüssigkeit angewandt wurden. Versuchsergebnisse für das Blasenwachstum und für das Zusammenbrechen in unterkühlter Flüssigkeit können in ähnlicher Weise approximiert werden, wenn man Wachstum und Zusammenbrechen getrennt betrachtet. Die Wachstumsgeschwindigkeit ist durch die oben erwähnte Erweiterung der Methode nach Bosnjakovic und Jakob gegeben. Die Geschwindigkeit des Zusammenbrechens kann, wie Bankoff und Mikesell gezeigt haben, aus der Lösung nach Rayleigh für den isothermen Prozess berechnet werden. Wenn man die Prozesse des Wachstums und des Zusammenbrechens kombiniert, indem man sie beim grössten Blasenradius aneinander anpasst, erhält man die vollständige Lebensbeschreibung von Blasen in unterkühlter Flüssigkeit.},

	abstract = {Prediction of bubble size which governs interfacial transfer terms between the two phases is of importance for an accurate prediction of the subcooled boiling flow. In the present work, a mechanistic bubbles size model, Sγ was examined to enhance the prediction capability of subcooled boiling flows for the {CFD} (computational fluid dynamics) code. In addition to this, advanced subcooled boiling models such as new wall boiling and two-phase logarithmic wall function models were also applied for an improvement of energy partitioning and two-phase turbulence models, respectively. The benchmark calculation against the {DEBORA} subcooled boiling data confirms that the Sγ bubble size model with the two advanced subcooled boiling models shows good prediction results and is applicable to the wide range of flow conditions that are expected in the nominal and postulated accidental conditions of a nuclear power plant.},

	abstract = {Experiments are performed on bubble detachment from an artificial cavity in a plane wall of a vertical rectangular channel. Mean upward velocity is varied. Steam bubbles are generated by local heating of the cavity, nitrogen bubbles of about the same size by injection. The experiments show a difference in take off direction between vapor and nitrogen bubbles. Steam bubbles take off into the liquid, while nitrogen bubbles more or less slide parallel to the wall. The bubble detachment radius decreases for increasing bulk liquid velocity, in a way that merely depends on the detachment radius without convection. Nitrogen bubbles, coming from a capillary with approximately the same radius are larger than water vapor bubbles. A force coefficient fit is performed on force components perpendicular to the wall. By analyzing flow- and non-flow experiments separately, some of the forces are quantified. By combining the results of nitrogen bubble and steam bubble experiments, a force due to the temperature difference at the bubble foot is studied. Such a force could explain the observed differences between steam and nitrogen bubbles. It is found that either a vorticity lift force of the type found by Auton [The dynamics of bubbles, drops and particles in motion in liquids, Ph.D. thesis, University of Cambridge (1983)] is negligible, or this temperature difference force may be important. A commonly used criterion to predict detachment radii is found not to be satisfactory.},

Force balances on a bubble as a whole should only be used in conjunction with some special bubble shape that only occurs at detachment if detachment criteria are to be derived.
