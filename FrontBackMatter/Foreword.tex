Dear reader,

\npar

This small section aims to detail and acknowledge some of the tools I used during my PhD to produce this work :

\begin{itemize}

\setlength{\itemsep}{10pt}

\item This thesis has been written using \LaTeX with TeXmaker (\url{https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/}) along with the MikTeX distribution (\url{https://miktex.org/}), based on the \texttt{classicthesis} package (\url{https://ctan.org/pkg/classicthesis}).

\item The bibliography has been handled using Zotero (\url{https://www.zotero.org/}).

\item All the models used outside of CFD computations have been developed using Python 3 (\url{https://www.python.org/}).

\item Most of the figures in this manuscript have been drawn using the Python 3 package \texttt{matplotlib} (\url{https://matplotlib.org/}) or the \LaTeX package TikZ (\url{https://tikz.net/}).

\item Fluid properties in Python 3 models have been computed using the \texttt{CoolProp} package (\url{http://www.coolprop.org/}):
