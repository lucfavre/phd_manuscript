	abstract = {A new mechanistic model for predicting the growth of sliding bubbles in subcooled boiling flow has been developed. The basis of this model is the assumption that the fundamental heat transfer mechanisms acting on a stagnant bubble growing at a nucleation site can also be applied to the growth of sliding bubbles. The physical assumptions of the existing bubble growth models were modified to reflect the intrinsic physics associated with the sliding bubble growth. The heat transfer mechanisms considered are microlayer evaporation, evaporation of superheated liquid, and condensation. The present model has been successfully validated against a broad set of subcooled flow boiling data, generated by three separate research groups using different working fluids and different heater surfaces. The model successfully reproduced the sliding bubble growth dependencies on mass flux, wall superheat, and liquid subcooling level as observed in the experiments. On the other hand, in a few cases where the bubble growth inertia was substantially involved in the sliding bubble growth, the predictive ability was limited.},

	abstract = {In the context of computational fluid dynamic simulations of boiling flows using time-averaged Eulerian multi-phase approaches, the many sub-models required to describe such a complex phenomena are of particular importance. Of interest here, wall boiling requires calculation of the contribution of evaporation to global heat transfer, which in turn relies on determination of the active nucleation site density, bubble departure diameter and frequency of bubble departure. In this paper, an improved mechanistic model for the bubble departure diameter during flow boiling is developed. The model is based on the balance of forces acting on a bubble at a single nucleation site, with a new equation governing bubble growth proposed. The formulation accounts for evaporation of the micro-layer under the bubble, heat transfer from superheated liquid around the bubble surface, and condensation on the bubble cap due to the presence of sub-cooled liquid. Validation of the growth equation is provided through comparison against experiments in both pool boiling and flow boiling conditions. Introduction of condensation on the bubble cap allows reproduction of the growth of the bubble for different sub-cooling temperatures of the surrounding liquid. In addition, a sensitivity study guarantees dependency of the bubble departure diameter on relevant physical quantities such as mass flow rate, heat flux, liquid sub-cooling and pressure, with any inclination of the channel walls correctly accounted for. Predictions of bubble departure diameter and bubble lift-off are validated against three different databases on sub-cooled flow boiling with water and an additional database on saturated boiling with refrigerant R113. The whole data set guarantees validation is performed over a range of parameters and operating conditions as broad as possible. Satisfactory predictive accuracy is obtained in all conditions. The present formulation provides an appropriate starting point for prediction of the behaviour of vapour bubbles under more general conditions which include lift-off after sliding, the frequency of bubble departure, bubble merging and bubble shrinking and collapse due to condensation.},

In this paper, the effects of these forces can be concluded by a series of dimensionless parameters including density ratio of vapor and liquid, Prandtl number, Jacob number and bubble Reynolds number. Based on the different forces, two different characteristic lengths are adopted to non-dimensionlize bubble departure diameters in horizontal flow boiling and vertical flow boiling, respectively. Finally, the semi-empirical correlations for bubble departure diameters in both horizontal and vertical subcooled flow boiling are proposed in this paper based on the force balance analysis and available experimental data from literature. The predicted results using the present correlations agree fairly well with the experimentally measured values with a mean relative error of 19.72\%.},

The model utilizes a force balance similar to that proposed by Klausner et al. (Int. J. Heat Mass Transfer 36, 651–662 (1993)). One significant improvement is that the inclination angle is determined on a dynamic basis and is not required as an input. Furthermore, it is hypothesized that the surface tension force is small compared to other forces acting on a vapor bubble at the points of departure and lift-off, and thus information on the bubble contact diameter and contact angles is not required. A new data set on mean vapor bubble lift-off diameters and probability density functions (pdf's) for flow boiling of refrigerant R113 on a nichrome heating strip has been obtained using the experimental facility described by Klausner et al.

	abstract = {An experiment is carried out using a high-speed camera to closely observe the bubble behaviors on a horizontal aluminum heating surface under high mass flux. Subcooled flow boiling experiments are conducted at Reynolds numbers of 61,850–124,041 for a range of density ratios (0.000647-0.001153), Jacob numbers corresponding to wall superheat (0.012201-0.025096) and for Jacob numbers corresponding to subcooling varying from 0.009549 to 0.02856. The experimental results indicate that both bubble departure diameter ({BDD}) and bubble contact diameter ({BCD}) reduce with increasing system pressure, increasing flow velocity, increasing subcooling, and decreasing wall superheat. The experiment confirms that the linear relationship between {BCD} and {BDD} is still valid under high mass flux. The {BCD} is 0.4027 times of the {BDD}. A force balance model based on the newly modified model of bubble growth rate is used to calculate {BDD} and its predicted values are in good agreement with the present measured values. The force balance model can be expressed by a series of dimensionless parameters: density ratio, Jacob number corresponding to wall superheat, Jacob number corresponding to subcooling, Prandtl number, Reynolds number, and contact angle. A new empirical formula of {BDD} in a horizontal channel is developed based on the dimensionless parameters using the Buckingham theorem. The empirical formula considers more comprehensive factors and predicts the {BDD} obtained in a horizontal channel with an average relative error of 12.08\%.},

	abstract = {The behavior of bubble coalescence in subcooled boiling has a significant influence on the void fraction and heat transfer capacity. In this paper, a visual flow boiling experiment is carried out to investigate the phenomenon of bubble coalescence and the effect of sliding bubbles on coalescence. The phenomenon of bubble coalescence, the velocity of bubble and interface evolution characteristics after coalescence are analyzed in detail. The annular waves caused by the rupture of the thick liquid film and the severe deformation caused by bubble coalescence are observed during the experiment. The propagation of annular waves on bubble surfaces makes bubbles unstable and then easily breaks down to produce secondary bubbles. Unlike the secondary bubbles produced by air bubble coalescence, the critical diameter of initial average bubbles that produce secondary bubbles after bubble coalescence is about 0.87 mm. This difference is because the viscosity of the fluid at high temperature in boiling two-phase flow is different from that in adiabatic water-air two-phase flow. Besides, it is found that there is an oscillation adjustment zone after bubble coalescence. This stage is divided into the violent oscillation region and moderation region, and their duration is basically the same. The relative velocity of sliding bubbles during collision is obtained according to the velocity difference between bubbles and the growth rate of the sliding bubble. Also, the effect of sliding bubbles on bubble coalescence is analyzed in this paper.},

	abstract = {The effects of orientation angle, subcooling, heat flux, mass flux, and pressure on bubble departure diameter in the isolated bubble regime of subcooled flow boiling were studied by high-speed video in a two-phase flow loop that can accommodate a wide range of flow conditions. Specifically, the following ranges were explored: orientation angles of 0° (downward-facing horizontal), 30°, 45°, 60°, 90° (vertical), and 180° (upward-facing horizontal); mass flux values of 250, 300, 350, and 400kg/m2s, corresponding to Froude numbers between 0.42 and 1.06; pressures of 101 (atmospheric), 202, and 505kPa; two values of the subcooling degrees (10 and 20°C); and two heat fluxes (0.05 and 0.10MW/m2). The combination of the test section design, high-speed video camera and {LED} lighting results in high accuracy (order of 20μm) in the determination of the bubble departure diameter. The data indicate that the bubble departure diameter increases with increasing heat flux, decreasing mass flux, decreasing subcooling, and decreasing pressure. Also, the bubble departure diameter increases with decreasing orientation angle, i.e. the largest bubbles are found to detach from a downward-facing horizontal surface. The mechanistic bubble departure diameter model of Klausner et al. and its recent modification by Yun et al. were found to correctly predict all the observed parametric trends, but with large average errors and standard deviation: 65.5±75.8\% for Klausner's and 37.9±51.2\% for Yun's. Since the cube of the bubble departure diameter is used in subcooled flow boiling heat transfer models, such large errors are clearly unacceptable, and underscore the need for more accurate bubble departure diameter models.},

	abstract = {In flow boiling systems, bubbles tend to slide along the wall as they depart from nucleation sites where they originate. This behavior has a profound impact on the wall heat transfer as evidenced in previous experiments. As a result, the heat transfer modeling associated with sliding bubbles has gained great attention within the {CFD} boiling heat transfer community. The modeling efforts are primarily aimed at improving the Heat Flux Partitioning ({HFP}) model by accounting for the heat transfer mechanisms introduced by sliding bubbles. The performance of the {HFP} model depends inherently on the accuracy of sub-models to predict the fundamental bubble parameters, such as bubble departure and lift-off diameters. Similarly, the accurate prediction of sliding bubble parameters, such as sliding bubble growth and sliding bubble velocity, is critical to improving the {HFP} model when taking into account the effect of sliding bubbles. Of the many sliding bubble parameters, this paper deals with the sliding bubble velocity. Specifically, a force balance model is presented and assessed in view of the sliding bubble velocity prediction. The experimental results from Maity (2000)[1] and Yoo et al. (2016)[2] are used to demonstrate the force balance model accuracy under various subcooled boiling conditions of both, water and refrigerant ({NOVEC}-7000) flowing upward in vertical channels. We performed a parametric study of the key sub-models (e.g., drag force, bubble growth) used in the force balance equation, together with a direct comparison with proposed models from other researchers. Then, a new force balance model is proposed which outperforms previous models and consistently well-predicts both sliding bubble velocity and growth.},

	abstract = {A forced convection boiling facility has been fabricated in which vapor bubble departure can be investigated. It has been observed that once a vapor bubble departs from its nucleation site, it typically slides along the heating surface and lifts off at some finite distance downstream. The probability density functions (pdfs) for bubble departure diameter, d, have been obtained for mass flux, C, ranging from 112 to 287 kg m−2 s−1 and heat flux, qw, ranging from 11.0 to 26.0 {kW} m−2. The data indicate a systematic dependence of d on G and qw. A detailed analysis of various forces acting on the bubble is presented and is used to predict the mean departure diameter. The onset of imbalance between the quasi-steady drag, the unsteady component of the drag due to asymmetrical bubble growth, and the surface tension force in the flow direction is used as a criterion for departure and yields satisfactory agreement between the measured and predicted values of the mean departure diameter. The analytical prediction shows a strong influence of mean liquid velocity and wall superheat on the bubble departure diameter.

As the first step of the validation process, the developed model was applied to experimental data obtained as part of this study. Comparison of the model predictions with the present data shows good agreement. In order to further validate/exercise the model, it was then applied to several data sets available in the literature. Though the data in the literature were for experimental conditions vastly different from those from which the model was originally developed, reasonable agreement between the model predictions and the experimental data were observed. This indicates that the proposed model can be extended to other flow conditions provided the submodels cover the conditions of the experiments. Future work should be directed towards improvement of the various submodels involved to extend their range of applicability, especially the ones related to bubble dynamics. Additionally, it must be kept in mind that the model as proposed is strictly only applicable to vertical up-flow and may not be applicable to other orientations.},

	abstract = {In this work a mechanistic model has been developed for the wall heat flux partitioning during subcooled flow boiling. The premise of the proposed model is that the entire energy from the wall is first transferred to the superheated liquid layer adjacent to the wall. A fraction of this energy is then utilized for vapor generation, while the rest of the energy is utilized for sensible heating of the bulk liquid. The contribution of each of the mechanisms for transfer of heat to the liquid—forced convection and transient conduction, as well as the energy transport associated with vapor generation has been quantified in terms of nucleation site densities, bubble departure and lift-off diameters, bubble release frequency, flow parameters like velocity, inlet subcooling, wall superheat, and fluid and surface properties including system pressure. To support the model development, subcooled flow boiling experiments were conducted at pressures of 1.03–3.2 bar for a wide range of mass fluxes 124-926kg/m2 s, heat fluxes 2.5-90W/cm2 and for contact angles varying from 30° to 90°. The model developed shows that the transient conduction component can become the dominant mode of heat transfer at very high superheats and, hence, velocity does not have much effect at high superheats. This is particularly true when boiling approaches fully developed nucleate boiling. Also, the model developed allows prediction of the wall superheat as a function of the applied heat flux or axial distance along the flow direction.},

	abstract = {Computational Fluid Dynamics ({CFD}) offers the opportunity to investigate physically and geometrically complex systems with high fidelity. Its applicability to multiphase flow, and particularly boiling heat transfer, is currently limited by the lack of appropriate closure models to describe all relevant phenomena. In this paper, we present an original subcooled flow boiling modeling framework for {CFD}, which aims at consistently and accurately characterizing the key physics that affect heat transfer at the boiling surface. The new framework introduces a fully mechanistic representation of heterogeneous boiling that improves numerical robustness and reduces sensitivity to closure coefficients. The proposed formulation is inspired by new experimental insight, and significantly extends the existing boiling models by capturing the effects of (i) the microlayer on surface evaporation, (ii) the boiling surface, and (iii) bubbles sliding along the boiling surface. A new statistical treatment of the location and mutual interactions of bubbles on the surface allows for mechanistic prediction of the dry surface area, an important quantity that affects the boiling heat transfer coefficient. This approach lends itself naturally to extension to very high heat fluxes, potentially up to the critical heat flux. An assessment and sensitivity study of the model is presented for a range of mass fluxes (500–1250kg/m2/s), heat fluxes (100–1600kW/m2), inlet subcoolings (5, 10, 15K), and pressures (1, 1.5, 2 bars), demonstrating improved robustness and predictive accuracy at all tested conditions in comparison to traditional heat partitioning approaches, including high heat fluxes, where classic models often fail to converge. Lastly, the framework proposed here should not be viewed as another heat partitioning model, but rather as a general platform that allows incorporation of advanced models for each physical phenomenon considered, leveraging the growing insight generated by modern experimental diagnostics for boiling heat transfer.},

Nonrotating and freely rotating spheres subject to a torque-free condition are both considered to evaluate the importance of spin-induced effects. The separation distance between the sphere and wall is varied from values at which the wall influence is weak down to gaps of half the sphere radius. The Reynolds number based on the sphere diameter and relative velocity with respect to the ambient fluid spans the range 0.1–250, and the relative shear rate defined as the ratio of the shear-induced velocity variation across the sphere to the relative velocity is varied from −0.5 to +0.5, so that the sphere either leads the fluid or lags behind it. The wall-induced interaction mechanisms at play in the various flow regimes are analyzed qualitatively by examining the flow structure, especially the spanwise and streamwise vorticity distributions. Variations of the drag and lift forces at low-but-finite and moderate Reynolds number are compared with available analytical and semiempirical expressions, respectively. In more inertial regimes, empirical expressions for the two force components are derived based on the numerical data, yielding accurate fits valid over a wide range of Reynolds number and wall-sphere separations for both nonrotating and torque-free spheres.},

	abstract = {This paper aimed to develop a mechanistic model for wall heat flux partitioning based on bubble dynamics in horizontal subcooled flow boiling. The model was established from two dimensions of space and time. In the space dimension, the heating surface was divided into three regions based on the motion characteristics of bubbles, including bubble nucleation region, bubble sliding region, and non-boiling region. In the time dimension, the heat transfer mechanism on the heating surface of the bubble nucleation region and bubble sliding region could be divided into evaporation, condensation, and transient heat transfer. An evaporation model for subcooled boiling was developed based on condensation at the top of the bubble. A transient quench heat transfer model for subcooled flow boiling was modified. The heat flux of each region was obtained by the sum of the time-averaged heat fluxes of these heat transfer mechanisms during a bubble periodic time. The total wall heat flux was obtained by the sum of the area weights of the heat fluxes in these three regions. The new wall heat flux partitioning model and the {RPI} model were used to predict the experimental values at a variety of flow conditions. The results showed that the new model could well predict the experimental values and the deviation between the predicted heat flux and the experimental results was within 25\%. The study also found that it was necessary to consider the condensation at the top of the bubble and the heat transfer mechanism caused by bubble sliding.},

	abstract = {The {NEPTUNE} project constitutes the thermal-hydraulic part of the long-term Electricité de France and Commissariat à l’Energie Atomique joint research and development program for the next generation of nuclear reactor simulation tools. This program is also financially supported by the Institut de Radioprotection et Sûreté Nucléaire and {AREVA} {NP}. The project aims at developing a new software platform for advanced two-phase flow thermal hydraulics covering the whole range of modeling scales and allowing easy multiscale and multidisciplinary calculations. {NEPTUNE} is a fully integrated project that covers the following fields: software development, research in physical modeling and numerical methods, development of advanced instrumentation techniques, and performance of new experimental programs.The analysis of the industrial needs points out that three main simulation scales are involved. The system scale is dedicated to the overall description of the reactor. The component or subchannel scale allows three-dimensional computations of the main components of the reactors: cores, steam generators, condensers, and heat exchangers. The current generation of system and component codes has reached a very high level of maturity for industrial applications. The third scale, computational fluid dynamics ({CFD}) in open medium, allows one to go beyond the limits of the component scale for a finer description of the flows. This scale opens promising perspectives for industrial simulations, and the development and validation of the {NEPTUNE} {CFD} module have been a priority since the beginning of the project. It is based on advanced physical models (two-fluid or multifield model combined with interfacial area transport and two-phase turbulence) and modern numerical methods (fully unstructured finite volume solvers). For the system and component scales, prototype developments have also started, including new physical models and numerical methods.In addition to scale-specific developments, the generalized use of multiscale calculations is also expected to be a major means to meet the industrial needs. The coexistence of different simulation scales together with the fast growth of computing power multiplies the computation possibilities. In particular, thanks to the recent progress of {CFD} tools, one can imagine local zooms in some critical parts of the reactor components. The {NEPTUNE} multiscale platform will offer advanced coupling functionalities based on state-of-the-art software architecture and new numerical coupling techniques.Finally, despite the existence of a huge worldwide database of two-phase flow experiments, the validation of new physical models (more local, more complex) requires new experimental data. That is the reason why for several years we have been developing new instrumentation techniques such as four-sensor optical probes, X-ray tomography, and hot-wire anemometry. These techniques will be used for new experimental programs (currently being launched) that have been defined in connection with the high-priority industrial applications (departure from nucleate boiling, pressurized thermal shock, loss-of-coolant accident, etc.).},

As the bubble grows, evaporation takes place at the bubble boundary, and the temperature and vapor pressure in the bubble are thereby decreased. The heat inflow requirement of evaporation, however, depends on the rate of bubble growth, so that the dynamic problem is linked with a heat diffusion problem. Since the heat diffusion problem has been solved, a quantitative formulation of the dynamic problem can be given. A solution for the radius of the vapor bubble as a function of time is obtained which is valid for sufficiently large radius. This asymptotic solution covers the range of physical interest since the radius at which it becomes valid is near the lower limit of experimental observation. It shows the strong effect of heat diffusion on the rate of bubble growth. Comparison of the predicted radius-time behavior is made with experimental observations in superheated water, and very good agreement is found.},

	abstract = {, Formation of a microlayer in nucleate boiling results in substantial changes to the heat-transfer dynamics of the process, and establishing a criterion to distinguish between the microlayer and contact-line regimes encountered is necessary to obtain a quantitative description of the nucleate-boiling phenomenon. In this work, we describe microlayer formation as a dewetting transition in the presence of phase change. We derive a specific criterion for modelling the transition based on a synthesis of existing theoretical, experimental and numerical data. As a result, a new formulation of the transition criterion is developed, and applied to (i) reference data from a dewetting experiment of a volatile liquid, and (ii) results derived from a high-resolution direct numerical simulation of nucleate boiling. In both cases, very good agreement is found for Jakob numbers ≲≲{\textbackslash}lesssim75, a range which covers many important boiling situations.},

	abstract = {The physical mechanisms associated with the evolution of a micro-layer beneath a bubble and the transition between contact line and micro-layer regimes are investigated with fully resolved numerical simulations, in the framework of nucleate pool boiling. Capturing the transition between these two regimes has been possible for the first time using very refined grids and parallel computations. Indeed, grids with a cell size under 1 μm must be used in order to capture thermal and dynamical effects in the micro-layer. Such multiscale computations require advanced code capabilities. The present simulations are used to analyse the physical processes involved in the formation and depletion of a micro-layer. A parametric study is carried out to investigate the impact of the main parameters affecting the presence of the micro-layer. From these results, the limit conditions between nucleate boiling in micro-layer and contact line regimes are deduced. Neglecting the micro-layer would lead to erroneous results because it has a strong influence on the overall bubble growth. Therefore the present results could be of major interest for designing models of nucleate pool boiling in larger scales computations, when the micro-layer cannot be resolved.},

	abstract = {The local thermal response of the liquid phase to the presence of sliding bubbles was measured with an infrared camera in subcooled flow-boiling conditions. These measurements were complemented with two high-speed cameras to capture the corresponding bubbles’ dynamics. The liquid–vapor interactions were captured in detail over the full life-cycle of sliding bubbles. Four distinctive phases for the bubble life-cycle were identified: A) Spherical bubble growth with strong attachment, B) Deformed bubble growth with weak attachment, C) Detachment with hot liquid quenching, and D) Cold liquid quenching. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, it is the first time that the “detachment with hot liquid quenching phase has been observed. This phase is characterized by a “hot” thermal footprint during the bubble detachment process. It is believed that this footprint is constituted partially from hot liquid released during the condensation of the recently detached bubble, and from released hot fluid previously collected by the bubble during sliding. In addition, this work reveals that using traditional high-speed visualization techniques (side-view camera only) can lead to an underestimation of approximately 40\% of the actual bubble–wall contact diameter (dc) which was inferred from the infrared camera measurements.},

	abstract = {We present an experimental methodology that enables accurate measurement of fundamental subcooled flow boiling quantities, such as nucleation site density, bubble growth and wait time, and bubble departure diameter, up to the Critical Heat Flux ({CHF}) limit. The methodology is based on high-speed video and high-speed {InfraRed} ({IR}) diagnostics, combined with advanced post-processing techniques developed in-house. It also provides hitherto unavailable direct estimates of the individual terms of wall heat flux partitioning in subcooled flow boiling; such information is crucially relevant to the validation of the latest mechanistic flow boiling heat transfer and {CHF} models. Experiments were performed using deionized ({DI}) water, on a rectangular cross-section channel (3 × 1 cm2), at atmospheric pressure and 10 °C of subcooling, for three mass fluxes (500 kg/m2/s, 750 kg/m2/s, and 1000 kg/m2/s). For each set of operating conditions, the average heat flux was escalated from single-phase forced convection up to the occurrence of {CHF}, and all boiling parameters were recorded at each heat flux. The trends of measured wait time, growth time and bubble departure diameter were successfully captured by mechanistic models developed or co-developed by the authors. Measurements of the wall heat flux partitioning have revealed that the contribution of microlayer evaporation increases monotonically with the increase of the average heat flux, due to the increase of nucleation site density and bubble departure frequency. However, for our specific heater and operating conditions, the contribution of the microlayer evaporation barely exceeds 50\% of the total heat flux, right before {CHF}.},

	abstract = {This study aims to better characterize the heat transfer and flow structure in the fully developed nucleate flow boiling regime in a semi-annular duct. Experiments with a refrigerant {HFE}7000 were performed in the range of Reynolds numbers from 13 000 to 40 500, subcoolings close to 15 ∘C, for constant heating power, constant wall temperature and constant heating rates (linear increase of the wall temperature). With constant heating power, the wall heat flux is well predicted by a Chen-type correlation based on a contribution due to the forced convection and a contribution due to nucleate boiling, including the effect of the liquid subcooling. A thin layer of bubbles sliding along the wall is observed. The characteristic diameter of the bubbles increases with the heat flux and decreases with the liquid velocity and its subcooling. The bubble diameters can be well predicted versus 3 dimensionless numbers: the Reynolds number of the flow, the Jakob number based on the liquid subcooling and the Boiling number. A drag coefficient of the bubbles sliding on the wall is estimated from the measurements of the bubble relative velocities and is in good agreement with the recent numerical simulation of Shi et al. [1] for a spherical bubble moving close to a wall in a shear flow. In the experiments with a constant set temperature, a non-homogeneity of the surface temperatures is observed as well as high fluctuations of temperatures and heat fluxes. The heat transfer is strongly degraded ( ≃ 60\%) by comparison with heating with a set power. Finally a transient nucleate boiling regime with a constant temperature increase {dT}/dt is investigated. For {dT}/dt {\textless} 50 ∘C.s−1, the results are similar to those of Auracher and Marquardt and a correlation for the prediction of the wall heat flux versus the wall temperature in the transient nucleate boiling regime is provided.},

These behaviors are less marked for motion on a 100-μm line surface, or on lines oriented parallel to the slope direction. Smaller droplets slide down with greater displacement in the line direction on 500-μm line patterning when the lines were rotated at 13° in-plane for the slope direction. This sliding behavior depended on the droplet size and rotation angle, and is accountable by the balance between gravitational and retentive forces.},

	abstract = {The three-dimensional flow around a spherical bubble moving steadily
 in a viscous 
linear shear flow is studied numerically by solving the full Navier–Stokes
 equations. 
The bubble surface is assumed to be clean so that the outer flow obeys
 a zero-shear-stress 
condition and does not induce any rotation of the bubble. The main goal
 of the 
present study is to provide a complete description of the lift force experienced
 by the 
bubble and of the mechanisms responsible for this force over a wide range
 of Reynolds 
number (0.1[les     ]Re[les     ]500, Re being based on 
the bubble diameter) and shear rate (0[les     ]Sr[les     ]1, Sr
 
being the ratio between the velocity difference across the bubble and the
 
relative velocity). For that purpose the structure of the flow field, the
 influence of the 
Reynolds number on the streamwise vorticity field and the distribution
 of the 
tangential velocities at the surface of the bubble are first studied in
 detail. It is shown 
that the latter distribution which plays a central role in the production
 of the lift force 
is dramatically dependent on viscous effects. The numerical results concerning
 the lift 
coefficient reveal very different behaviours at low and high Reynolds numbers.
 These 
two asymptotic regimes shed light on the respective roles played by the
 vorticity 
produced at the bubble surface and by that contained in the undisturbed
 flow. At low 
Reynolds number it is found that the lift coefficient depends strongly
 on both the 
Reynolds number and the shear rate. In contrast, for moderate to high Reynolds
 
numbers these dependences are found to be very weak. The numerical values
 obtained 
for the lift coefficient agree very well with available asymptotic results
 in the low- and 
high-Reynolds-number limits. The range of validity of these asymptotic
 solutions is 
specified by varying the characteristic parameters of the problem and examining
 the 
corresponding evolution of the lift coefficient. The numerical results
 are also used for 
obtaining empirical correlations useful for practical calculations at finite
 Reynolds 
number. The transient behaviour of the lift force is then examined. It
 is found that, 
starting from the undisturbed flow, the value of the lift force at short
 time differs from 
its steady value, even when the Reynolds number is high, because the vorticity
 field 
needs a finite time to reach its steady distribution. This finding is confirmed
 by an 
analytical derivation of the initial value of the lift coefficient in an
 inviscid shear flow. 
Finally, a specific investigation of the evolution of the lift and drag
 coefficients with the 
shear rate at high Reynolds number is carried out. It is found that when
 the shear rate 
becomes large, i.e. Sr=O(1), a small but 
consistent decrease of the lift coefficient 
occurs while a very significant increase of the drag coefficient, essentially
 produced by 
the modifications of the pressure distribution, is observed. Some of the
 foregoing 
results are used to show that the well-known equality between the added
 mass 
coefficient and the lift coefficient holds only in the limit of weak shears
 and nearly 
steady flows.},

	shorttitle = {Temperature dependence of the contact angle of water},
	abstract = {Contact angle, a quantitative measure of macroscopic surface wettability, plays an important role in understanding liquid-vapor heterogeneous phase change phenomena, e.g., boiling heat transfer. The contact angles of water at elevated temperatures are of particular interest for understanding of wettability-regulated boiling heat transfer in steam-based power generation. From a more theoretical perspective, the temperature dependence of contact angle of water is also essential to estimation of several key surface thermodynamic properties, such as the solid surface tension, the surface entropy, and the heats of immersion and adsorption. Here, a comprehensive review of historical efforts in measuring the contact angles of water over a wide temperature range on a variety of solids, not limited to metallic surfaces, is presented. As suggested by the literature data, the temperature dependence of contact angle of water may be classified into three regimes: (a) low temperatures below the saturation point (i.e., 100 °C at atmospheric pressure), (b) medium temperatures up to {\textasciitilde}170 °C, and (c) high temperatures up to 300 °C at pressurized conditions. A slightly-decreasing or nearly-invariant trend of the contact angles of water on both non-metallic and metallic surfaces was reported for the low-temperature regime. In contrast, a steeper linear decline in water contact angle was demonstrated at temperatures above 100 °C. The few experimental data available on several metallic surfaces showed that the contact angle of water either again becomes nearly temperature-independent or further decreases with temperature above 210 °C. A theoretical understanding of the temperature dependence is given based on surface thermodynamic analysis, although the exact molecular mechanisms underlying these experimental observations remain unclear. Consequently, the theoretical model for predicting the variation of the contact angle of water with temperature is not well-developed. As the critical point of water (374 °C and 22.1 {MPa}) is approached, the surface tension, and hence the contact angle, should become vanishingly small. However, this theoretical expectation has not yet been verified due to the lack of experimental data at such high temperatures/pressures. Finally, future research directions are identified, including a systematic exploration of the contact angle at near-critical temperatures, the effects of surface oxidation, corrosion, and deposition on contact angle during operation of boilers and reactors, and the particular effect of irradiation on contact angle in nuclear reactor applications.},

	abstract = {A visual study of vapor bubble growth and departure in vertical upflow and downflow forced convection boiling is presented. A vertical flow boiling facility was constructed with a transparent, electrically-heated test section in which the ebullition process could be observed. High-speed digital images of flow boiling phenomena were obtained, which were used to measure bubble growth, departure diameters, and lift-off diameters. Experiments were conducted for flow of {FC}-87 over a commercially-finished nichrome heating surface, with mass flux ranging from 190 to 666 kg m−2 s−1 and heat flux ranging from 1.3 to 14.6 {kW}{\textbackslash}m2. The flow was slightly subcooled (ΔTsub = 1.0–5.0°C), and boiling occurred at isolated nucleation sites. A major conclusion of this work is that the observed vapor bubble dynamics between upflow and downflow are significantly different. In the upflow configuration, bubbles departing the nucleation site slide along the heater wall, and typically do not lift off. In the downflow configuration, bubbles either lift off directly from the nucleation site or slide and then lift off, depending on flow and thermal conditions. The process of vapor bubble sliding appears to be responsible for enhanced energy transfer from the heating surface, as evidenced by larger heat transfer coefficients for upflow than for downflow under otherwise identical operating conditions.},

The experiments show a difference in take off direction between vapor and nitrogen bubbles. Steam bubbles take off into the liquid, while nitrogen bubbles more or less slide parallel to the wall. The bubble detachment radius decreases for increasing bulk liquid velocity, in a way that merely depends on the detachment radius without convection. Nitrogen bubbles, coming from a capillary with approximately the same radius are larger than water vapor bubbles. A force coefficient fit is performed on force components perpendicular to the wall. By analyzing flow- and non-flow experiments separately, some of the forces are quantified. By combining the results of nitrogen bubble and steam bubble experiments, a force due to the temperature difference at the bubble foot is studied. Such a force could explain the observed differences between steam and nitrogen bubbles.

	abstract = {The physical principles governing bubble growth in a superheated liquid were originally formulated by Bosnjakovic and Jakob. Using these principles, Fritz and Ende derived an approximate formula for the growth of a bubble in a uniformly superheated liquid. It is shown below that the energy considerations in the Bosnjakovic-Jakob analysis enable one to calculate also the approximate rate of growth of a bubble on a heated surface in a liquid at saturation. One need only take into account the heat flux from the heated surface to the liquid. One can improve the agreement with experimental data by making corrections which have already been applied by other authors to bubbles in a uniformly superheated liquid. Experimental data for bubbles growing and collapsing in subcooled boiling can be approximated similarly by considering the growth and collapse process separately. The growth rate is given by the extended Bosnjakovic-Jakob analysis described above. As shown by Bankoff and Mikesell, the collapse rate can be predicted by the solution of Rayleigh's equation for an isothermal process. The growth and collapse process can be combined by matching them at the maximum bubble radius, thus giving a complete picture of the life history of bubbles formed in subcooled boiling.
Résumé
Les principes physiques qui régissent le développement d'une bulle dans un liquide surchauffé ont été formulés, à l'origine par Bosnjakovic et Jakob. En utilisant ces principes, Fritz et Ende ont déduit une formule approchée pour le grossissement d'une bulle dans un liquide uniformément surchauffé. Il est montré ci-dessous que les considérations énergétiques de l'analyse de Bosnjakovic-Jakob permettent également de calculer la vitesse approchée de grossissement d'une bulle à la surface chauffée d'un liquide saturé. Il suffit de tenir compte du flux de chaleur de la surface chauffée vers le liquide. On peut améliorer l'accord avec les données expérimentales en faisant les corrections déjà appliquées par les autres auteurs aux bulles dans un liquide uniformément surchauffé. Les données expérimentales pour des bulles grossissant et éclatant au cours d'une ebullition à basse température sont susceptibles d'une similitude approximative si l'on considère séparément les processus du grossissement et de l'éclatement. La vitesse de grossissement est donnée par l'extension de l'étude de Bosnjakovic-Jakob décrite ci-dessus. Comme l'ont montre Bankoff et Mikesell, la vitesse d'éclatement peut être prévue par la solution de l'équation de Rayleigh pour un processus isotherme. Grossissement et éclatement peuvent être combinés pour le rayon de bulle maximum, donnant ainsi une vue complète de l'histoire de la vie des bulles qui se forment dans l'ébullition à basse température.
Zusammenfassung
Die physikalischen Prinzipien des Blasenwachstums in überhitzter Flüssigkeit sind ursprünglich von Bosnjakovic und Jakob formuliert worden. Fritz und Ende leiteten unter Benutzung dieser Prinzipien eine Näherungsgleichung für das Blasenwachstum in gleichförmig überhitzter Flüssigkeit ab. Es wird weiter unten gezeigt, dass man mit Hilfe der Energiebetrachtungen von Bosnjakovic und Jakob auch das Blasenwachstum an einer Heizfläche in gesättigter Flüssigkeit näherungsweise berechnen kann, wenn man den Wärmestrom von der Heizfläche zur Flüssigkeit in Betracht zieht. Beim Vergleich mit Versuchsergebnissen sind Korrekturen erforderlich, wie sie auch von anderen Autoren auf Blasen in gleichförmig überhitzter Flüssigkeit angewandt wurden. Versuchsergebnisse für das Blasenwachstum und für das Zusammenbrechen in unterkühlter Flüssigkeit können in ähnlicher Weise approximiert werden, wenn man Wachstum und Zusammenbrechen getrennt betrachtet. Die Wachstumsgeschwindigkeit ist durch die oben erwähnte Erweiterung der Methode nach Bosnjakovic und Jakob gegeben. Die Geschwindigkeit des Zusammenbrechens kann, wie Bankoff und Mikesell gezeigt haben, aus der Lösung nach Rayleigh für den isothermen Prozess berechnet werden. Wenn man die Prozesse des Wachstums und des Zusammenbrechens kombiniert, indem man sie beim grössten Blasenradius aneinander anpasst, erhält man die vollständige Lebensbeschreibung von Blasen in unterkühlter Flüssigkeit.},

	abstract = {L'etude du comportement en corrosion des materiaux de gainage du combustible d'un reacteur nucleaire a eau sous pression en presence d'ebullition necessite une connaissance precise de l'environnement thermohydraulique et chimique des elements combustibles. Or, dans les conditions de fonctionnement des rep (15,5 mpa et 340{\textbackslash}c), la topologie de l'ecoulement diphasique a la paroi des gaines n'a jamais encore ete caracterisee. Un dispositif de visualisation, adapte sur l'installation experimentale reggae, permet d'obtenir de nouvelles donnees a la fois qualitatives et quantitatives. Parmi les grandeurs accessibles figurent la taille et la forme des inclusions de vapeur, le point de demarrage de l'ebullition, les vitesses et les trajectoires des bulles. Une methode d'analyse d'image originale est ensuite mise en uvre pour mesurer le taux de vide et la concentration d'aire interfaciale dans un ecoulement diphasique a bulles. Ainsi, le dispositif de visualisation permet de caracteriser la topologie de l'ecoulement diphasique dans les conditions des rep en ebullition nucleee sous-saturee. L'analyse des resultats experimentaux montre la necessite d'une approche tres locale pour modeliser l'environnement chimique des gaines en presence d'ebullition. Un nouveau modele d'enrichissement en especes faiblement volatiles est donc propose puis valide. Les bulles de vapeur sont desormais considerees comme des obstacles physiques limitant l'acces du liquide a la paroi, et l'evaluation de leur diametre joue un role determinant sur l'environnement chimique des gaines. Cette etude confirme, tant au niveau experimental que theorique, l'existence de fortes interactions entre la topologie de l'ebullition, la corrosion, les caracteristiques de la paroi et la chimie de l'eau.},

	abstract = {Several situations in which a spherical bubble experiences a lift force are examined, especially through the use of computational results obtained by solving the full Navier–Stokes equations. The lift force is computed over a wide range of Reynolds number for the case of pure shear flow, pure strain and solid body rotation. Using these results, the validity of asymptotic solutions derived in the limit of low Reynolds number or inviscid flow is discussed. A general expression of the lift force valid for low to moderate shears is proposed. It is shown that for such shears, the lift force in a complex flow can be predicted by superposing the results obtained in pure strain flow and solid body rotation flow. Finally, the interaction force experienced by two bubbles rising side-by-side is studied. The computational results reveal that, at variance with the predictions of potential theory, the sign of this force changes when the Reynolds number or the separation distance between the bubbles decreases below a critical value. All these results are discussed in terms of vorticity. The respective role played by the vorticity generated at the bubble surface and by the one that is eventually present in the unperturbed flow is emphasized.},

Dans ces deux situations, la croissance et le détachement des bulles sont filmés par caméra vidéo rapide.

La force d'Archimède et la force de traînée exercée par l'écoulement de liquide ont tendance à détacher la bulle et la force capillaire à la maintenir à la paroi.

Zusammenfassung
Für die Blasenwachstumsraten in einer gleichmässig überhitzten Flüssigkeit wurde eine einfache allgemeine Beziehung abgeleitet. Die Beziehung ist für beide Gebiete, sowohl für das Trägheitskraft-wie auch für das Wärmediffusions- geregelte Wachstum gültig. Die abgeleitete Beziehung kann sehr gut mit den vorhandenen experimentellen Ergebnissen für das Blasenwachstum in einer gleichmässig überhitzten Flüssigkeit verglichen werden. Die Ergebnisse erstrecken sich auch auf das Blasenwachstum in einem nicht einheitlichen Temperaturfeld, was angenähert den Bedingungen für das Blasensieden an einer beheizten Oberfläche entspricht.},

	abstract = {During nucleate boiling, a thin liquid film (microlayer) is formed beneath a boiling bubble when the bubble undergoes rapid growth/expansion. The linear distribution of the microlayer has been previously confirmed, and its crest shape has been observed in the isolated bubble region of nucleate boiling. However, the microlayer behavior in larger heat flux regions up to critical heat flux has not yet been elucidated. In this study, to further understand the microlayer structure in the whole heat flux range of nucleate boiling, microlayer configuration was measured using laser interferometry. Water was adopted as the test fluid, and it is confirmed that the microlayer can be observed over a whole range of nucleate boiling containing the critical heat flux point. It is also confirmed that the deformation of the microlayer from axisymmetric shape was caused by complicated, irregular bubble motions such as bubble coalescence, which was observed for relatively higher heat flux. The crest shape of the microlayer, which appears near the periphery of its maximum diameter under relatively smaller heat flux, was not observed at a relatively higher heat flux. Finally, it is confirmed that heat flux does not obviously influence the thickness distribution of the initial microlayer.},

	abstract = {During nucleate pooling boiling, a microlayer forms on the heat transfer surface beneath a growing bubble. In previous studies, the existence of a microlayer was confirmed, and its structure was investigated by using several different experimental methods. However, the characteristics and mechanism of the formation of a microlayer have not been thoroughly elucidated to date. In this study, in order to obtain further understanding on the microlayer structure, a laser interferometric method was adopted for a more detailed observation. As a result, it was observed that the special bended shape of the microlayer forms near its outer margin when the microlayer radius is close to its maximum value. By analyzing the variation of the ratio of bubble height to diameter, it can be inferred that the detachment of a bubble causes a decrease of the initial microlayer thickness when the microlayer thickness is close to the maximum radius. This effect explains the formation of the bended shape of initial microlayer.},

	abstract = {As a bubble grows outside of a cavity during nucleate boiling, viscous effects can be large enough compared to surface tension to impede liquid motion and trap a thin liquid layer, referred to as the microlayer, underneath the growing bubble. Numerical simulations of nucleate boiling typically resolve the macroscopic liquid-vapor interface of the bubble, but resort to subgrid models to account for micro scale effects, such as the evaporation of the microlayer. Evaporation models require initialization of the microlayer shape and extension, but models for microlayer formation are either physically incomplete or purely empirical. In this work, the Volume-Of-Fluid ({VOF}) method, implemented in the Gerris code, is used to numerically reproduce the hydrodynamics of hemispherical bubble growth at the wall, and resolve the formation of the microlayer with an unprecedented resolution. The simulations are validated against the latest experimental data and compared to existing analytical models. Lastly, remaining gaps in building a generally applicable model for the formation of the microlayer are presented.},

Physics-based models that describe boiling heat transfer, when coupled with Computational Fluid Dynamics ({CFD}), can be an invaluable tool to increase the performance of such systems. Existing modeling approaches do not incorporate all relevant heat transfer mechanisms at the wall, limiting their predictive capability and general applicability. These shortcomings restrict the application of {CFD} in the design process. For the nuclear industry, this means having to rely on expensive experimental campaigns to develop and license new reactor designs.

Recent advances in the instrumentation of boiling experiments via infrared thermometry have provided new insights on {DNB} physics that were ignored in past modeling efforts. The growing consensus from experimental studies that {DNB} is caused by a microhydrodynamic phenomenon at the boiling surface, instead of the classical macrohydrodynamic scale effects, has yet to be formulated into a working model and applied for simulation of high pressure conditions representative of {PWRs}. While the idea of an energy imbalance between wetted (in contact with liquid) and dry (in contact with vapor) areas has been suggested by multiple experimental groups [1-6] as a triggering mechanism for {DNB}, incorporating this new understanding into a functional boiling model remains an open challenge.},

	abstract = {A novel experimental method and data acquisition/analysis strategy that ensures reliable measurements of various subcooled flow boiling parameters is discussed. In this study, all experiments were performed by keeping a single active nucleation site within the entire heated area in a square upward flow channel. This approach greatly facilitated the observation of bubble and wall heat transfer features in subcooled boiling flow. Vapor bubbles originating from the nucleation site were observed with both micro- and macroscopic views from high-speed cameras while corresponding wall temperature was measured by an infrared camera. This allowed simultaneously capturing various bubbles characteristics with multiple scales (both space and time) as well as their impact on wall heat transfer. In addition, efforts were made to characterize the observed boiling behavior with high statistical accuracy by analyzing numerous images taken at each test condition. This study proves that by taking the current strategy excellent repeatability and thus reliability can be achieved for a wide range of flow boiling parameters such as bubble size, bubble velocity, statistical distribution of bubble size and time-averaged wall heat transfer coefficients. Also, the major sources of uncertainty for each measurement are thoroughly investigated, from which the final uncertainties are determined. Overall, the present study suggests what we must concern to achieve truly reliable and useful data from any boiling experiments.},

	abstract = {This second of two companion papers presents an analysis of sliding bubble and wall heat transfer parameters measured during subcooled boiling in a square, vertical, upward flow channel. Bubbles were generated only from a single nucleation site for better observation of both the sliding bubble characteristics and their impact on wall heat transfer through optical measurement techniques. Specific interests include: (i) bubbles departure and subsequent growth while sliding, (ii) bubbles release frequency, (iii) coalescence of sliding bubbles, (iv) sliding bubbles velocity, (v) bubbles size distribution and (vi) wall heat transfer influenced by sliding bubbles. The results showed that sliding bubbles involve two distinct growth behaviors: (i) at low mass fluxes, sliding bubbles grew fast near the nucleation site, subsequently shrank, and then grew again, (ii) as mass flux increased, however, sliding bubbles grew more steadily. The bubbles originating from the single nucleation site coalesced frequently while sliding, which showed close relation with bubbles release frequency. The sliding bubble velocity near the nucleation site consistently decreased by increasing mass flux, while the observation often became reversed as the bubbles slid downstream due to the effect of interfacial drag. The sliding bubbles moved faster than the local liquid (i.e., ur{\textless}0) at low mass flux conditions, but it became reversed as the mass flux increased. The size distribution of sliding bubbles followed Gaussian distribution well both near and far from the nucleation site. The standard deviation of bubble size varied insignificantly through sliding compared to the changes in mean bubble size. Lastly, the sliding bubbles enhanced the wall heat transfer and the effect became more noticeable as inlet subcooling/mass flux decreased or wall heat flux increased. In particular, the sliding bubble characteristics such as bubble growth behavior observed near the nucleation site played a dominant role in determining the ultimate level of wall heat transfer enhancement within the test channel.},

	abstract = {The general method of Izakson and Millikan for the derivation of the well-known Prandtl-Nikuradse skin friction law is applied to the analysis of turbulent heat and mass transfer in pipes, channels, and boundary layers. The formula for the heat (or mass) transfer coefficient (or the Nusselt number) is obtained which contains the dimensionless coefficients of the universal logarithmic equations for the velocity and temperature profiles as parameters of the formula. One of these parameters is a universal function of Prandtl (or Schmidt) number and all the others are constants. The existing velocity and temperature profile measurements in various turbulent wall flows permit the determination of all the necessary coefficients with fair accuracy. The resulting calculations are in satisfactory agreement with numerous experiments on heat and mass transfer in pipes and boundary layers on a flat plate over the Prandtl (or Schmidt) number range from 6 × 10−3 to 106 and over two orders of magnitude of Reynolds (or Péclét) number variations.
Résumé
La méthode générale d'Izakson et Millikan pour l'obtention de la loi classique de Prandtl-Nikuradse pour le frottement superficiel est appliquée á l'analyse du transfert thermique et massique turbulent dans des tubes, des canaux et des couches limites. La formule donnant le coefficient (ou le nombre de Nusselt) de transfert thermique (ou massique) contient, en tant que paramétres, les coefficients sans dimension des équations logarithmiques universelles des profils de vitesse et de température. Un de ces paramétres est une fonction universelle du nombre de Prandtl (ou de Schmidt) et tous les autres sont des constantes. Les profils de vitesse et de température expérimentaux existants dans différents écoulements pariétaux turbulents permettent avec une bonne précision la détermination de tous les coefficients nécessaires. Les calculs qui en résultent sont en accord satisfaisant avec les nombreuses expériences sur le transfert thermique et massique dans des tubes et des couches limites sur plaque plane, pour un domaine de nombre de Prandtl (ou de Schmidt) compris en 6. 10−3 et 106 et pour une variation du nombre de Reynolds (ou Péclét) couvrant deux ordres de grandeur.
Zusammenfassung
Die allgemeine Methode von Izakson und Millikan zur Ableitung des bekannten Prandtl-Nikuradse-Reibungsgesetzes wird auf die Analyse der turbulenten Wärme- und Stoffübertragung in Rohren, Kanälen und Grenzschichten angewandt. Die abgeleitete Formulierung des Wärme (Stoff) übergangskoeffizienten (oder der Nusselt-Zahl) enthält als Parameter die dimensionslosen Koeffizienten der universellen logarithmischen Gleichung für die Geschwindigkeits- und Temperaturprofile. Einer dieser Parameter ist eine universelle Funktion der Prandtl-(oder Schmidt)Zahl und alle anderen sind Konstanten. Die vorhandenen Geschwindigkeits- und Temperatur-Profil-Messungen in verschiedenen turbulenten Wandströmungen erlauben die Festlegung aller notwendigen Koeffizienten mit guter Genauigkeit. Die resultierenden Ergebnisse sind in zufriedenstellender Übereinstimmung mit zahlreichen experimentellen Untersuchungen über den Wärme- und Stofftransport in Rohren und an Grenzschichten an einer, ebenen Platte für Prandtl-(oder Schmidt)Zahlen im Bereich von 6 × 10−3 bis 106 und über zwei Grössenordnungen der Reynolds-(oder Péclét)Zahl.},

Bubble size, frequency and the distribution of nucleation sites were measured at 1.7 m s−1 inlet velocity, 84 K subcooling, 0.08-mm wall thickness and heat fluxes 70–95\% of the critical flux. The observations were consistent with a model for heat transfer primarily by surface quenching at the bubble frequency, supplemented by single-phase convection and a small contribution from microlayer evaporation. Although the total population of nucleation sites increased with increasing wall superheat, the startup of new sites deactivated many of the sites active at lower superheat.
Résumé
Dans une recherche expérimentale de l'ébullition nucléée d'un écoulement sous-refroidi d'eau à la pression atmosphérique sur l'acier inoxydable, il est trouvé que le coefficient de transfert thermique croît avec l'augmentation du sous-refroidissement et aussi avec l'accroissement de l'épaisseur de la paroi dans le domaine 0,08–0,20 mm. La taille de bulle, la fréquence et la distribution des sites de nucléation sont mesurées à une vitesse d'entrée 1,7ms−1,à 84 K de sous-refroidissement, pour une épaisseur de paroi de 0,08 mm et des flux thermiques à 70–95\% du flux critique. Les observations s'accordent avec un modèle de transfert thermique principalement dû à une trempe de la surface à la fréquence des bulles et augmenté par une convection monophasique et par une petite contribution de l'évaporation de micro-couche. Bien que la population totale de sites de nucléation augmente avec la surchauffe de la paroi, le démarrage de nouveaux sites désactive beaucoup de sites actifs à de plus faibles surchauffes.
Zusammenfassung
Bei experimentellen Untersuchungen des unterkühlten Strömungssiedens von Wasser bei Atmosphärendruck an rostfreiem Stahl wurde festgestellt, daβ der Wärmeübergangskoeffizient mit gröβer werdender Unterkühlung zunimmt und ebenso mit steigender Wandstärke im Bereich von 0,08 bis 0,20 mm. Gemessen wurden Blasengröβe, Frequenz und Verteilung der Siedekeime bei einer Eintrittsgeschwindigkeit von 1,7 m s−1, einer Unterkühlung von 84 K, einer Wandstärke von 0,08 mm und bei Wärmestromdichten, die 70 bis 95\% der kritischen Wärmestromdichte betragen. Die Beobachtungen stimmten mit einem Wärmeübertragungsmodell überein, welches in erster Linie die Oberflächenwiederbenetzung mit der Blasenfrequenz beschreibt, überlagert durch einphasige Konvektion und einen kleinen Anteil ‘microlayer’-Verdampfung. Obwohl die Gesamtzahl der Siedekeime mit gröβer werdender Wandüberhitzung zunimmt, deaktiviert der Start neuer Keimstellen viele bei geringerer überhitzung aktive Keimstellen.

	title = {Etude expérimentale et modélisation du transfert de chaleur de l'ébullition transitoire},
	rights = {Licence Etalab},
	url = {https://www.theses.fr/2018INPT0145},
	abstract = {L’étude de l’ébullition transitoire est un enjeu important pour la sureté nucléaire. Un tel phénomène peut se produire lors d’un accident de type {RIA} (Reactivity Initiated Accident)dans un réacteur nucléaire où le pic de puissance au niveau d’un crayon de combustible peut déclencher une ébullition transitoire conduisant à une forte augmentation de la température de la gaine et à un risque de rupture. Plusieurs études en conditions réacteurs ont permis d’obtenir des courbes d’ébullition transitoires mais la modélisation qui en découle manque encore de fiabilité. Dans le cadre d’une collaboration avec l’Institut de Radioprotection et de Sûreté Nucléaire ({IRSN}), une expérience modèle a été construite à l’Institut de Mécanique des Fluides de Toulouse ({IMFT}). Elle génère un écoulement de réfrigérant {HFE}7000 dans un canal de section semi-annulaire, simulant l’écoulement autour d’un crayon de combustible, dont la partie intérieure, composée d’une feuille de métal, est chauffée rapidement par effet Joule, simulant l’échauffement de la gaine du crayon. La thermographie infra-rouge permet de mesurer la température de la paroi externe du métal. L’application d’une peinture noire sur le métal augmente son émissivité mais aussi la résistance thermique de la paroi. La précision de la mesure de la température d’intérêt a été optimisée en fonction de l’épaisseur de peinture et une correction sur le bilan d’énergie prend en compte ce paramètre. Ces mesures sont couplées avec une caméra rapide qui permet de visualiser les régimes d’ébullition et d’obtenir des tailles de bulles à l’aide de la mise en place d’algorithmes de traitement d’image. On représente sur un diagramme flux-température les transferts thermiques lors des différents régimes en stationnaire et en transitoire. Chaque régime d’ébullition, en conditions stationnaire ou transitoire, est alors passé en revue : la convection, le déclenchement de l’ébullition, l’ébullition nucléée, la crise d’ébullition, l’ébullition en film et le remouillage. Les régimes stationnaires sont correctement modélisés par des corrélations usuelles. La convection transitoire est caractérisée sur toute la paroi et son évolution se rapproche de la solution quasistationnaire. Il est montré que les transferts thermiques lors du passage vers l’ébullition nucléée sont dépendants de la formation d’une importante poche de vapeur qui se propage sur la paroi. Une étude locale de cette propagation est alors nécessaire. Afin de simuler des transitoires de température durant l’ébullition nucléée, un système d’asservissement de type P.I.D. permet d’imposer des créneaux ou des rampes de températures (de 5 à 500 K.s 1 ). Les résultats en ébullition nucléée sont conformes avec ceux de la littérature, tant en conditions stationnaire que transitoire. L’expérience permet d’étudier le transfert de chaleur lorsqu’un film de vapeur se forme et isole la paroi. Ce régime d’ébullition en film, pendant la chauffe ou le refroidissement de la paroi peut ainsi être stabilisée pendant plusieurs secondes avec ce système.

	abstract = {Rise characteristics of vapor bubbles after the departure from a nucleation site in forced convective subcooled flow boiling were studied visually using two synchronized high speed video cameras. The test section was a transparent glass tube of 20mm in inside diameter, filtrated and deionized tap water was used as a working fluid, and the flow direction adopted was vertical upward. The outer surface of test section tube was electrically heated to generate vapor bubbles inside of the tube. In the present experiments, the mass flux and liquid subcooling were varied within 94–1435kg/m2s and 2.2–10K, respectively. Since the observations were performed at low heat fluxes to avoid the significant increase in the number of active nucleation sites, the obtained bubble images were clear enough to carry out the detailed image analysis for the rise characteristics of individual bubbles. The following three different bubble rise paths were observed after the departure from nucleation sites: some bubbles slid upward the vertical wall for long distance, while other bubbles were detached from the wall after sliding for several millimeters and then migrated toward the bulk liquid; after the migration, some of the detached bubbles were collapsed in subcooled liquid but others remained close to the wall and were reattached to the wall. The results of detailed image analyses suggested that the variation in bubble shape from flattened to more rounded was of primary importance for the occurrence of bubble detachment from the wall.},

	abstract = {Experiments are reported in which organic liquids underwent pool boiling at low pressure, forming large vapour bubbles on the surface of a heater plate consisting of glass or ceramic. The temperature at the surface of the heater was measured, leading to support for the hypothesis that a thin layer of liquid (the microlayer) forms beneath the vapour bubble. From the experimental observations it is possible to deduce the thickness of the microlayer, which can also be predicted from a simple theory for the hydrodynamics of the formation of the layer. Experiment and theory agree within ±25 per cent for the limited cases available. The rates of growth of the bubbles are shown to be of the same order as the rates of evaporation from the microlayers, which can be expressed in analytic form under certain assumptions. A computer program for bubble growth allowing for the microlayer and other factors has been developed and applied to two bubbles growing under widely different bulk temperatures. The predicted radii are within ±15 per cent of those observed. The relative magnitudes of stresses due to inertia, surface tension, viscosity and gravitation are determined for a typical bubble, and discussed in relation to bubble shape and microlayer formation. It is stressed that these results may not apply to widely different conditions of boiling.
Résumé
On décrit des expériences dans lesquelles des liquides organiques subissent und ébullition en réservoir à faible pression, en formant de grandes bulles de vapeur sur la surface d'une plaque chauffante en verre ou en céramique. La température de la surface du chauffoir a été mesurée, conduisant à confirmer l'hypothèse qu'une couche mince de liquide (la microcouche) se forme sous la bulle de vapeur. Il est possible de déduire, à partir des observations expérimentales, l'épaisseur de la microcouche, qui peut aussi être prédite à partir d'une théorie simple pour l'hydrodynamique de la formation de la couche. L'expérience et la théorie sont d'accord à ±25 pour cent près pour les cas limités disponibles. On montre que les vitesses de croissance des bulles sont du même ordre que les vitesses d'évaporation à partir des microcouches, qui peuvent être exprimées sous forme analytique avec certaines hypothèses. Un programme de calculateur pour la croissance des bulles tenant compte de la microcouche et d'autres facteurs a été exploité et appliqué à deux bulles croissant avec des températures globales largement différentes. Les rayons prévus sont à ±15 pour cent de ceux observés. Les grandeurs relatives des contraintes dues à l'inertie, à la tension superficielle, à la viscosité et à la gravitation sont déterminées pour une bulle typique, et discutées en relation avec la forme de la bulle et avec la formation de la microcouche. On a insisté sur le fait que ces résultats ne peuvent pas s'appliquer à des conditions d'ébullition largement différentes.
Zusammenfassung
Es wird über Versuche berichtet, bei denen organische Flüssigkeiten unter Bildung von grossen Dampfblasen an der Oberfläche einer beheizten Platte aus Glas oder Keramik dem Sieden in freier Konvektion bei niederem Druck unterzogen wurden. Die Oberflächentemperatur des Heizeelements wurde gemessen, weil sie massgebend für die Aufrechterhaltung der Hypothese ist, dass dich unter der Blase eine dünne Flüssigkeitsschicht (Mikroschicht) bildet. Aus experimentellen Beobachtungen ist es möglich, auf die Dicke der Mikroschicht zu schliessen, die auch über eine einfache Theorie für die Hydrodynamik der Schichtbildung berechnet werden kann. Für die wenigen vorliegenden Fälle ergeben sich zwischen Experiment und Theorie Abweichungen von ±25 Prozew. Es zeigt sich, dass die Wachstumsraten der Blasen von derselben Grössenordnung wie die Verdampfungsraten der Mikroschichten sind, die unter gewissen Voraussetzungen in analytischer Form dargestellt werden können. Ein Rechenprogramm für das Blasenwachstum wurde unter Berücksichtigung der Mikroschicht und anderer Faktoren entwickelt und auf zwei Blasen, die bei sehr verschiedenen Flüssigkeitstemperaturen entstehen, angewendet. Die berechneten Radien stimmen auf ±15\% mit den beobachteten überein. Die bezogenen Grössen für die Trägheitskraft, Oberflächenspannung, Zähigkeit und Schwerkraft werden für eine typische Blase bestimmt und im Zusammenhang mit der Blasenform und Mikroschichtbildung diskutiert. Es wird mit Nachdruck darauf hingewiesen, dass diese Ergebnisse nicht auf zu sehr abweichende Seidezustände angewendet werden dürfen.},

	abstract = {Understanding and controlling nucleate pool boiling phenomena in zero gravity conditions is fundamental for space applications. An analytical model for the equilibrium radius reached by a bubble nucleated in sub-cooled conditions is established in this work and verified numerically. Indeed, direct numerical simulations of two phase flows conjugated with the heat conduction in the solid wall are carried out in order to verify and correct the analytical model. Fine grids, with cells size of the order of the micron, are mandatory in order to capture the subtle equilibrium between condensation and evaporation that characterises stationary conditions. This has been possible thanks to the house made solver {DIVA}, validated for nucleate pool boiling simulations, and that permits to carry out parallel numerical simulations. Results show that the equilibrium radius of the bubble is a function of the thermal gradient, of the Jakob numbers associated with condensation and evaporation and of the apparent contact angle. The analysis of the thermal field is carried out and an interpretation of the physical processes that characterise the equilibrium is given. In addition, useful information on the heat transfer behaviour, reported in terms of Nu numbers, completes the work.},

	abstract = {The nucleate subcooled boiling is an efficient heat transfer form and plays an important role in many cooling applications. In nucleate subcooled boiling, nucleation site density ({NSD}) and bubble departure frequency ({BDF}) are two key parameters, which determine the amount of heat taken away by vapor bubbles from the heating surface. In the present work, an experiment is carried out to closely observe the boiling behaviors on horizontal aluminum heating surface at system pressures from 121 to 312 {kPa}, flow velocities from 0.5 to 2.0 m/s and subcooling degrees from 5 to 15 K using high-speed photography. A bubble tracking algorithm is developed, which efficiently determines the locations of active nucleation sites. Results show that values of active {NSD} and {BDF} are greater in conditions of elevated wall superheat degrees and system pressures. Comparatively, liquid subcooling and flow velocity have little effects on the active {NSD} and {BDF}. Regarding the inconsistencies between experimental data of the current study and predicted data of existing models, revised models are proposed. The newly proposed empirical formula of active {NSD} conforms well to the experimental data with a mean relative error of 25.27\%. The modified model for {BDF} based on the dimensionless {BDF} and dimensionless heat flux agrees well with experimental data with a mean relative error of 21.25\%.},

La première partie porte sur l'analyse des résultats expérimentaux obtenus sur la boucle {DEBORA} du {CEA}/Grenoble. Une étude bibliographique critique des modèles monodimensionnels de taux de vide, de température de paroi, de pertes de pression et la comparaison de ces modèles aux résultats expérimentaux ont permis d'établir un ensemble de modèles applicables à la modélisation monodimensionnelle des écoulements bouillants sous-saturés d'eau et de fréon 12.

Ces simulations donnent de bons résultats malgré de nombreuses hypothèses simplificatrices. Cherchant à améliorer la modélisation de l'ébullition en paroi et à la décomposition du flux transmis de la paroi vers le fluide, on met en évidence les lacunes qui existent à ce jour et les travaux qu'il serait intéressant d'entreprendre. Par ailleurs, on s'intéresse au diamètre des bulles qui est impose et uniforme dans le code de calcul alors que les résultats expérimentaux montrent clairement que ce diamètre varie fortement le long de l'écoulement. On montre cependant que cette hypothèse de diamètre uniforme donne des résultats satisfaisants bien qu'une prédiction plus précise de cette grandeur pourrait probablement permettre une amélioration quantitative des résultats. Cela nous a amnés à étudier les possibilités d'introduction d'une équation de transport d'aire interraciale dans les écoulements bouillants afin de mieux décrire l'évolution du diamètre des bulles. Cette étude montre qu'à ce jour il manque encore des informations au niveau local, et que des études expérimentales doivent être menées notamment pour mieux appréhender les phénomènes de nucléation en paroi.},

La simulation de ces écoulements est aujourd'hui identifiée comme une voie possible d'amélioration pouvant conduire à la compréhension des mécanismes physiques menant à la crise d'ébullition en réacteur. La première partie de ce travail présente un modèle bi-dimensionnel quasi-établi capable de prédire de façon indépendante les profils de température et de vitesse dans un écoulement diphasique. Le découplage des équations implique de disposer de paramètres d'entrée (taux de vide, vitesse). Ce modèle est basé sur une approche de type modèle de mélange et sur la fermeture des termes de transport turbulent avec le concept de viscosité turbulente. La seconde partie généralise le modèle au cas bi-dimensionnel non-établi en proposant un outil qui résout de façon couplée toutes les équations de bilan et qui est basé sur l'utilisation d'un modèle original de type modèle homogène local avec relaxation thermodynamique. Une confrontation des résultats du modèle à des résultats expérimentaux fournis par la banque de données {DEBORA} a révélé que notre approche semblait suffisante pour rendre compte d'une bonne partie des données expérimentales en conditions {REP}. Mais néanmoins qu'elle présentait quelques limites dans des conditions poches du flux critique. Ce travail a permis de mettre en évidence les paramètres sensibles du modèle qui sont aujourd'hui bien identifiés à savoir les mécanismes de transport turbulent d'énergie et le choix du temps de relaxation.},

	abstract = {Dans les écoulements diphasiques l'organisation spatio-temporelle adoptée par les constituants tient une place prépondérante dans le développement de l'écoulement. Dans le cas d'écoulements en déséquilibre thermodynamique, cette caractéristique voit son rôle accru par la présence de transfert d'énergie entre phases. Le but principal de l'étude est de contribuer, dans l'optique d'une modélisation fine des mécanismes régissant les écoulements diphasiques, à la description expérimentale des phénomènes d'évolution de la structure locale d'un écoulement liquide vapeur engendré par ébullition d'un fluide caloporteur. L'installation expérimentale {DEBORA}, sur laquelle sont réalisées les mesures, simule, à l'aide de freon 12 circulant dans un tube de 19,2 mm de diamètre intérieur et de 3,5 m de longueur chauffante, les écoulements d'eau dans le cœur d'un réacteur à eau sous pression (R. E. P. ) en fonctionnement transitoire de classe I ou {II} (pression de 10 a 18 {MPa}, vitesse massique de 1 a 5 Mg/m²/s, flux chauffant de 0. 5 a 6 {MW}/m2, titre thermodynamique de -0,4 a 0,4). La première étape de l'étude a consisté a déterminer les techniques d'instrumentation adaptées à la mesure des paramètres principaux de la structure locale des écoulements diphasiques. La technique de discrimination phasique par microsonde optique s'est révélée comme la mieux adaptée aux conditions expérimentales. L'adéquation de cette technique aux conditions de mesures industrielles rencontrées sur {DEBORA} a été assurée par la conception et la réalisation d'un capteur spécifique. Une méthode originale de traitement des données fournies par une sonde optique est proposée. Cette méthode s'inspire de travaux menés dans le domaine de la stéréologie en étendant les potentialités des traitements classiques aux conditions réelles de l'écoulement: inhomogénéité spatiale de répartition des bulles. Elle permet, en outre, d'accéder en temps réel aux paramètres principaux de la structure locale d'un écoulement à bulles sphériques: taux de vide, diamètre caractéristique, répartition en taille. Des mesures d'évolution de ces paramètres caractéristiques ont été réalisées dans une large gamme de conditions d'écoulement et sont complétées par des mesures locales de température liquide. L'ensemble de ces résultats traite à l'aide d'un logiciel d'interpolation par splines pseudo cubiques à validation croisée, constitue une banque de données de référence. Son analyse permettra de confronter, voire, à terme, d'élaborer les modèles implantés dans les codes de calculs thermohydrauliques tridimensionnels.},

In the present experiments, the bubbles produced at nucleation sites were commonly lifted off the vertical heated surface. They were then propelled into the subcooled bulk liquid to disappear due to heat transfer with subcooled liquid. It was frequently observed that the bubbles were suddenly accelerated in the lateral direction before the disappearance. Using the present observation results, new correlations were developed for the bubble lift-off velocity and the bubble acceleration phenomenon after the lift-off. It was shown that the bubble trajectories and the time-variation of bubble size calculated using the present correlations are in fairly good agreement with the experimental results.},

The fundamental features of the lift-off diameter and nucleation frequency (i.e., the variations across nucleation sites and the dependence on the flow and heat flux conditions) were addressed based on the present observation. A database for the bubble lift-off diameter was built by gathering and summarizing the data of Prodanovic et al., Situ et al., and the present experiments. We evaluated the predictive capabilities of Unal's model, Situ et al.'s model, and Prodanovic et al.'s correlation against the database. We obtained the best prediction results by modifying the wall superheat correlation in Unal's model.

The test section was a vertical rectangular channel, and a copper surface of low contact angle was used as a heated surface. Main experimental parameters were the pressure, mass flux and liquid subcooling. Although all the experiments were conducted under low void fraction conditions close to the onset of nucleate boiling, no bubbles stayed at the nucleation sites at which they were formed. Depending on the experimental conditions, the following two types of bubble behavior were observed after nucleation: (1) lift-off from the heated surface followed by collapsing rapidly in subcooled bulk liquid due to condensation, and (2) sliding along the vertical heated surface for a long distance. Since the bubble lift-off was observed only when the wall superheat was high, the boundary between the lift-off and the sliding could be determined in terms of the Jakob number. Based on the present experimental results, discussion was made for the possible mechanisms governing the bubble dynamics.},

Ce dernier objectif nous a conduits à nous intéresser à la modélisation mécaniste de l'ébullition nucléée sous-saturée en convection forcée. Après une analyse bibliographique critique, nous avons identifié des améliorations physiques, en particulier la prise en compte du glissement des bulles le long de la paroi chauffante. Cette voie a nécessité le développement d'une approche de type « bilan des forces » pour renseigner le diamètre de détachement des bulles de leur site actif de nucléation et le diamètre de décollage des bulles de la paroi. Un nouveau modèle d'ébullition nucléée a, pour finir, été proposé, en relation avec ces développements, et évalué de manière préliminaire.},

Changes in heat flux and sub-cooling did not affect the distribution of active nucleation sites although additional active sites formed among the sites which had already been activated when heat flux was increased. The frequency of vapor bubble emission and the bubble flux density have been studied as well. The results obtained showed that the heat flux had a great effect on the vapor bubble emission frequency although the influence of subcooling was of lesser significance.

An aqueous solution of nickel salts containing 20\% solids was boiled at atmospheric pressure on a horizontal, flat, copper surface 2 in. in diameter in a 71/2-in. vessel with no forced convection. The technique for determining active sites consisted of plating a thin layer of nickel on the copper surface during the boiling runs and subsequently counting the number of pin holes in the plate. The heat flax was varied from 7,680 to 535,000 Btu/(hr) (sq ft) and the {DELTA} t from 17.3 deg to 216.8 deg F. Counts of active sites were obtained from zero to a maximum of 1,13O/sq in. at 317,000 Btu/(hr) (sq ft). A random geometrical distribution of active sites was revealed by a photographic study of the nickel-plated heated surface. For this system a linear relationship between the number of active sites and the heat flux, as suggested by Jakob, is nonexistent. The heat flux was proportional approximately to the square root of the number of sites. Widely known theoretical analyses for nucleate-boiling heat transfer do not include the functionality in the latter manner. (auth)},

	abstract = {A criterion is developed for bubble initiation from a gas filled cavity on a surface in contact with a superheated layer of liquid. It is found that the temperature of bubble initiation on a given surface is a function of the temperature conditions in the liquid surrounding the cavity as well as the surface properties themselves. It is also found that the delay time between bubbles is a function of the bulk liquid temperature and the wall superheat, and is not constant for a given surface. By consideration of the transient conduction into a layer of liquid on the surface, a thermal layer thickness is obtained. With this thickness and a critical wall superheat relation for the cavity, a bubble growth rate is obtained. Bubble departure is considered and it is found that the Jakob and Fritz relation works as long as the true (non-equilibrium) bubble contact angle is used. At one gravity the primary effect of bubble growth velocity on bubble departure size is found to be due to contact angle changes.
Résumé
On expose un critère pour la formation de bulles à partir d'une cavité remplie de gaz sur une surface en contact avec une couche surchauffée de liquide. On trouve que la température de formation de bulles sur une surface donnée est une fonction des conditions de température dans le liquide entourant la cavité aussi bien que les propriétés de surface elles-mêmes. On trouve aussi que la durée entre les bulles successives est une fonction de la température globale du liquide et de la surchauffe de la paroi et n'est pas constante pour une surface donnée. En considérant la conduction transitoire dans une couche de liquide sur la surface, on obtient une épaisseur de couche thermique. Avec cette épaisseur et une relation critique de surchauffe de paroi pour la cavité, on obtient une vitesse de croissance de bulle. On considère le détachement de la bulle et on trouve que la relation de Jakob et Fritz est valable aussi longtemps qu'on emploie le vrai angle de contact (en non-equilibre). Pour une gravité unité, on trouve que le principal effet de la vitesse de croissance des bulles sur la taille des bulles au détachement est due aux changements de l'angle de contact.
Zusammenfassung
Für das Entstehen von Blasen aus einer mit Gas gefüllten Vertiefung an einer Oberfläche in Berührung mit einer überhitzten Flüssigkeitsschicht wird ein Kriterium entwickelt. Es ergab sich, dass die Temperatur beim Blasenentstehen an einer gegebenen Oberfläche eine Funktion der Temperaturbedingungen in der Flüssigkeit ist, die die Vertiefung ebenso wie die Oberflächenbeschaffenheiten selbst umgibt. Es zeigte sich ebenfalls, dass die Verzögerungszeit zwischen den Blasen eine Funktion der Flüssigkeitstemperatur und der Wandüberhitzung und keine Konstante für eine gegebene Oberfläche ist. Unter Berücksichtigung der Ableitung in eine Flüssigkeitsschicht an der Oberfläche erhält man eine thermische Schichtdicke. Mit dieser Dicke und einer Beziehung der kritischen Wandüberhitzung für die Vertiefung erhält man eine Blasenwachstumsgeschwindigkeit. Das Ablösen der Blasen wird beobachtet und dabei gefunden, dass die Beziehung von Jakob und Fritz solange gilt, wie der wahre (nicht im Gleichgewicht befindliche) Randwinkel der Blase eingesetzt wird. Bei Normalschwere findet man, dass der primäre Einfluss der Blasenwachstumsgeschwindigkeit auf die Ablösegrösse der Blasen von Veränderungen des Randwinkels hervorgerufen wird.},

	abstract = {A new model for active nucleation site density in boiling systems has been developed and preliminarily applied in Computational Fluid Dynamics ({CFD}) simulations of subcooled boiling in a vertical heated tube. The new model is based on a parametric analysis of existing experimental data. It is a function of three variables: wall superheat, pressure, and contact angle; and is applicable in a wide range of pressures: 0.101 {MPa}–19.8 {MPa}. A preliminary study of the temperature dependence of the contact angle has been performed during the development process. The new model is intended to improve the predictions of: (i) interfacial area concentration in two-fluid models, and (ii) wall temperature in subcooled boiling simulations. For the active nucleation site density itself, the verification results showed that the values predicted by the newly developed model are in good agreement with various published experimental data. The model also demonstrated improvements of other existing models. The new model was utilized in {CFD} simulations of subcooled boiling in a vertical heated tube. The predicted void fraction and wall temperature in subcooled boiling flow agree well with the experimental data.},

The equation is valid for the transition region and for the range of fully developed turbulent flows. It is pointed out that it is not possible to obtain a generally valid heat transfer equation in the form proposed by Nusselt (1909). An equation of general validity can, however, be derived by making use of the fundamental form developed by Prandtl (1944) on the basis of momentum theory.},

	abstract = {In this work, a pilot-scale pressurized fluidized bed test rig was built to test the heat transfer performance between the supercritical {CO}2 ({sCO}2) loaded immersed tube with the dense bed. Results showed that the bed-to-tube heat transfer coefficient ({HTC}) in {CO}2 atmosphere was slightly larger than that in air atmosphere. The {HTC} increased with the increase of pressure and bed temperature, respectively. The increase of pressure did not change the circumferential distribution of {HTC}, but the increase of fluidization number improved it. A bed-to-tube heat transfer model was proposed on the basis of the partial heat penetration theory with the accuracy in ±25 \%. For the heat transfer of {sCO}2 within the immersed tube deteriorated due to the buoyancy effect.
The direct-condensation convection-radiation panel ({DCRP}) was authenticated to be competitive in thermal performances and heating efficiencies, which contributed to energy conservations in space heating. To promote the application of the heating terminal, a comprehensive model of {DCRPs} with different connection modes and panel numbers is established in this paper. The accuracies of the model are validated with experimental data. The comparison results show that the deviations of the refrigerant outlet temperature, outlet enthalpy, pressure drop and heating capacity range from −10.8 \% to 6.2 \%, −2.4 \% to 5.3 \%, −10.9 \% to 11.5 \%, −8.4 \% to 3.0 \%, within the acceptable range. Based on the comprehensive model, the flow and heat transfer potentials of the {DCRPs} are investigated. Under the same structural parameters, the heating capacity of the single panel is maximal, followed by the outermost panel, the innermost panel and the middle panel of the {DCRP}. Meanwhile, the heating capacity and flow resistance loss of the {DCRPs} in parallel mode are superior to that in series mode. The average radiation proportion of the {DCRPs} declined from 48.1 \% to 14.4 \% as the panel number increased from one to three. As corroborated by application analysis, the {DCRP} with a single panel is more suitable for a residential room with an area of less than 15 m2, while the {DCRP} with three parallel panels is more appropriate for a room higher than 20 m2.
The flow boiling performance of R245fa was investigated in a bare stainless-steel tube ({BT}) and a sintering and electroplating modulated stainless-steel tube ({SET}). The test tubes had the same inner diameters of 10.02 mm and effective heat transfer lengths of 800 mm. The mass fluxes, inlet vapor mass qualities and heat fluxes were in ranges of 192.61–705.35 kg/(m2·s), 0.01–0.9 and 4.99–74.97 {kW}/m2, respectively. Three flow patterns were identified in both {BT} and {SET}. The annular flow pattern conversion line of {SET} was earlier than that of the {BT}. With the increase in vapor quality, the boiling heat transfer coefficient increased and then decreased at q ≤ 45 {kW}/m2, whereas it decreased at q ≥ 60 {kW}/m2. For the {BT}, the heat transfer coefficient was weakly affected by the mass flux, but it increased with the increase in mass flux for the {SET}. For the {BT} and {SET}, the frictional pressure drop increased and then decreased with the increase in mean vapor quality at a certain heat flux. Owing to the strong wettability of {SET}, the thick liquid film at the tube bottom in stratified flow was forced to the tube top and the liquid droplets in annular flow were captured by the surface coating. Thus, flow patterns were modulated to enhance heat transfer. The maximum of the heat transfer enhancement ratio and performance evaluation parameter can reach 2.87 and 2.79, respectively.
{CO}2 capture from coal-fired power plants ({CFPP}) with low cost is crucial for China to achieve carbon peaks in 2030. The manuscript proposes a novel combined cycle of supercritical {CO}2 Brayton cycle ({SCBC}) and organic Rankine cycle ({ORC}) in {CFPP} with {CO}2 capture. The novelty of the proposed scheme lies on its high-level thermal integration which can efficiently complete the conversion of heat to electricity, waste heat recovery, and {CO}2 capture. Exergy analysis and levelized cost of electricity ({LCOE}) are employed to respectively evaluate the thermodynamic and economic performance. The simulation results show that the exergy efficiency of the combined cycle is 39.74\% as considering {CO}2 capture, resulting in a 3.41\% of efficiency penalty. The introduction of {ORC} improves the exergy efficiency by 1.05\%. The {LCOE} of the combined cycle is 79.03\$/{MWh}, almost 19.3\$/{MWh} (32.29\%) more expensive than the base plant, and the costs of {CO}2 captured and avoided are respectively 21.81\$/{tCO}2 and 26.25\$/{tCO}2. The results indicate that the proposed combined cycle has the potential to compete with other carbon capture technologies from the views of exergy efficiency and cost. Coal combustion in the S–{CO}2 boiler and the calciner is responsible for the maximum internal exergy destructions, and increasing the cycle maximum temperature may reduce the exergy destruction. The largest cost contributor to {LCOE} is associated with capital expenditures (41.55\%), and the cost reduction efforts should be aimed at capital expenditures.
Organic Rankine cycle ({ORC}) can effectively utilize the waste heat energy of internal combustion ({IC}) engine. The {ORC} system has obvious large time-varying characteristic, strong fluctuation, and hysteresis under the synergistic influence of frequent fluctuation of vehicle speed and operating parameters in the system. The power system, waste heat recovery system, transmission system, and other subsystem models are constructed in this study. The key components are verified. An integrated system model of {IC} engine–{ORC} for driving cycle is constructed on the basis of the subsystem model. The dynamic response of {ORC} system is evaluated under different road conditions. The synergistic influence of multiple variables on system performance is analyzed. Obvious strong coupling and nonlinear characteristics are observed among different performances of {ORC} system under road conditions. Therefore, a multi-objective cooperative optimization framework of {ORC} system considering actual road conditions is proposed on the basis of multidimensional data. In the process of collaborative optimization, thermal efficiency and emissions of {CO}2 equivalent show a clear trade-off under different road conditions. The limit value of thermal efficiency under new European driving cycle is also 6.48\% higher than that under worldwide harmonized light vehicles test cycle. Frequent fluctuation of vehicle speed is not conducive to obtaining the limit value of thermal efficiency. The evaluation and optimization of the comprehensive performance of {ORC} system under complex road conditions can provide a reference for the practical application of vehicle {ORC} system.
Supercritical heat transfer has already been applied for decades, as it has several benefits such as improved thermal efficiency of the thermodynamic cycle. Accurate knowledge about supercritical heat transfer and pressure drop of the different working fluids is required to design the heat exchangers and other components used in these systems. In literature, supercritical heat transfer of water and {CO}2{\textless}math{\textgreater}{\textless}msub is="true"{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow is="true"{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow is="true"{\textgreater}{\textless}mn is="true"{\textgreater}2{\textless}/mn{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}/msub{\textgreater}{\textless}/math{\textgreater} has already been widely investigated, the research involving refrigerants (for their application in low-temperature heat conversion systems) is however rather scarce. This paper gives an overview of the existing research on supercritical heat transfer. An overview of the applications, general characteristics and the main findings for water and other fluids are summarized. Due to the sharp variations in thermophysical properties, heat transfer and pressure drop cannot be accurately predicted on a single-phase based approach only. An in-detail review of the current research and status of knowledge about supercritical heat transfer of refrigerants is presented. The effect of the different investigated refrigerants and operating parameters on heat transfer and pressure drop, both for heating and cooling applications, is discussed. The remaining gaps in literature are highlighted, which include studies involving larger diameter tubes, horizontal flow, cooling heat transfer and pressure drop estimations and creation of a wider database for a more general correlation development and measurements on newer refrigerants (with low Global Warming Potentials) as these will become increasingly important in the near future. In addition, advances in numerical research should focus on development of suitable turbulence models. Overall, further improving the basic understanding of the fluid structure and occurrence of deteriorated heat transfer, as well as forming reliable models for the thermophysical properties are key in future efforts.},

	abstract = {Understanding of subcooled flow boiling and the critical heat flux ({CHF}) is of the utmost importance for both safety and profitability of pressurized water nuclear reactors since they are major factors in the determination of the reactor power rating. Motivated by the emergence of a new wall boiling model by Gilman [3] and previous experimental insights from Phillips [12], a first-of-a-kind experimental investigation of pressurized steady-state subcooled flow boiling was conducted using state-ofthe- art diagnostics to gain a unique insight of the relevant mechanisms, including the partitioning of the wall heat flux. Conditions up to 10 bar pressure, 2000 kg/m²s mass flux and 20 K subcooling were explored. High-speed infrared thermometry tools were developed and used to measure the local time-dependent 2-D temperature and heat flux distributions on the boiling surface. These distributions were analyzed to determine fundamental boiling heat transfer parameters such as the nucleation site density, growth and wait times, nucleation frequency, departure diameter as well as the partitioning of the wall heat flux. While established mechanistic models can capture the trends of growth time and wait time with relatively good accuracy, this work reveals current models do not accurately predict the activation and interaction of nucleation sites on the boiling surface. This is a major roadblock, since boiling curves and {CHF} values obtained in nominally identical environments can be significantly different depending upon the nucleation site density which in turn is determined by the surface properties. The role of evaporation in the partitioning of the heat flux increases monotonically as the average heat flux increases, up to a maximum value of 70\%, and is the dominant mechanism at high heat fluxes. At low and intermediate heat fluxes single-phase heat transfer is the dominant mechanism. Traditional heat partitioning models fail to capture these physics, but newer models with a comprehensive and physically consistent framework show promise in predicting the wall heat transfer. The data and understanding produced by this work will be essential for the development and validation of these modeling tools.},

Comparison of model predictions against local and axial measurements (heat fluxes ranged from 152.9 to 705.0kW/m2) is made for the void fraction, Sauter mean bubble diameter and interfacial area concentration covering a range of different mass and heat fluxes and inlet subcoolings. Good agreement is achieved between the predicted and measured profiles.
